ODM leader Raila Odinga has endorsed Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi as the next governor of Nairobi. This comes at a time when 2022 politics is taking shape in Nairobi. ODM's Evans Kidero was the first Governor in 2013, but lost to Jubilee's Mike Sonko last year. Speaking at Kabete Technical where he attended a football match sponsored Wanyonyi, Raila said the MP will be ODM's flag bearer. "Although I'm here as a football player and not a politician, I want to say our next Nairobi Governor is Tim. He is doing a good job, and deserves the ODM ticket in 2022," Raila said. The former Prime Minister said the MP's development speaks for itself, and that is why he attended the match to support him. Raila said the standard of Kenyan football is rising following Harambee Stars' qualification for the African Cup of Nations. The AU Envoy said he accompanied Gor Mahia to Everton because he wants more talents nurtured. "Football is now doing well in Kenya. Recently, I accompanied Gor Mahia to Everton and I was proud of the game they played," he said. Wanyonyi has also received support from other ODM leaders who also attended the cup final. Dubbed Tim Wanyonyi Super Cup, the tournament started three months ago featuring both girls and boys teams. The tournament final came days after the MP organised a symposium for women to showcase their products. More than 16,000 women are beneficiaries of a table banking project he is runs in the constituency. Wanyonyi asked the government to invest more in sports. He said that it is a unifying factor especially in a country divided on tribal lines. "This tournament brought together sponsors who are scouting for talent," he said. MPs Babu Owino, George Aladwa, Antony Oluoch and several MCAs attended the event. Click here for the latest political news
