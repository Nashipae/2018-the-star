Drivers and passengers plying the Lamu-Garsen road currently under construction want the contractor to start work on terror hotspots first. H-Young company was awarded a Sh10.8 billion tender in January, 2017 to build the 135km road, which connects Lamu to the rest of the coast and Kenya. Resident engineer Willis Ingari said the road is 20 per cent complete. The terror hotspots include Milihoi, Minjila, Gamba, Nyongoro, Mambo Sasa, Lango la Simba and Witu. Motorists said the contractor had started working on the safer parts of the road and was taking too long to move to the rest of it. The hotspots have poor roads that makes it impossible for drivers to speed off in case of attacks by al Shabaab and many have lost their lives.
