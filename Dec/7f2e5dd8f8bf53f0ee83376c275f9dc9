Three people were on Thursday killed by bandits at Karon and Kaakong areas along the border of West Pokot and Turkana counties. Among them was a boy aged eight who was looking after cattle at Karon village, North Pokot subcounty. The other two were killed at Kaakong and Nakwomoru villages by suspected bandits from West Pokot county. West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo on Thursday issued a stern warning to bandits wreaking havoc along the border of the two communities. "They should stop what they have started doing. We have stayed in peace for more than three years and we don’t want anybody to disrupt peace," the Governor said in Kapenguria on Thursday. Lonyangapuo condemned the incidents calling on leaders and residents not to incite locals and retaliate in case of an attack. "We don’t want conflicts. We should stay together in peace as neighbours. As leaders and security team we are working on how to end this menace," he said. West Pokot police commandant Mathew Kuto said the attackers did not steal animals.
