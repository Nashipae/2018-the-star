Police have introduced daytime alcoblow tests to curb road carnage during the festive season. Inspector of General Joseph Boinnet on Friday said the alcoblow will remain in place even after the festive season to apprehend drunk drivers. “We will be ruthless and shall use different tactics to arrest criminals,” Boinnet said. He was speaking at the police headquarters during a celebrations to congratulate 25 police officers who were recognised for their outstanding acts of bravery in the maintenance of law and order.The officers were awarded by the Manu Chandaria Foundation. “We thank them for doing a good work. They represent the majority of our officers doing a great job in the service for our country,” Chandaria said. Boinnet said alcoblow is aimed at getting rid of drunkards who get to the road early morning while they are still inebriated. "They risk killing themselves or murdering innocent people. We have to follow the law and respect the rights of other people as well,” Boinnet said. The IG said police will work together with the National Transport and Safety Authority to implement traffic rules. He said police will also work with the public to maintain law and order.
