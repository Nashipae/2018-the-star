The Supreme Court has ordered a fresh election in Embakasi South, raising hopes for ODM's Irshad Sumra to return to Parliament. The court, in a ruling delivered on Friday, held that incumbent Julius Mawathe was not duly elected on August 8, 2017. Mawathe moved to the top court after Appeals court in July overturned the lower court's decision to uphold his win. Justice Mohammed Warsame, who read the judgement on behalf of judges Kathurima Minoti and Daniel Musinga, set aside the High court judgement. The appellate court observed that the election was not conducted in a free and fair manner.
