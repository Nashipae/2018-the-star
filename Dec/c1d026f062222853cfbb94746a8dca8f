A Nairobi lawyer has moved to court seeking orders to declare Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko unfit to hold public office. Boniface Nyamu wants the court to bar the governor from transacting any county business until their case is heard and determined. He has listed over 10 grounds which he says show that Sonko is unfit to hold the office of governor. They include verbally assaulting an MCA, recording private phone calls, refusing to nominate a deputy governor, among others. Nyamu wants the court to declare that the respondent has engaged in different acts of gross misconduct that are insulting to the people of Nairobi. He argues that the county boss has violated the obligations conferred to him under the Constitution, "which is against the constitutional rights of the people of Nairobi county." "The governor is, therefore, unfit to hold any public office paving way for fresh gubernatorial election in Nairobi," the petition reads in part. In September, Jubilee MCAs backed down on plans to impeach Sonko saying there were 'no compelling reasons' to remove the governor. On September 6, MCAs debated the state of the county and set out conditions for Sonko to avoid removal from office. Among them was for the governor to relocate from his Mua home in Machakos county to City Hall. They also told him to appoint a deputy governor, stop demolitions of kiosks, recall suspended officers, and reopen closed offices at City Hall.
