Homeboyz coach Simon Odongo has urged his charges to turn around their fortunes after a dismal start to the season. The Enterprise Cup champions have failed to fire from all cylinders this season, winning two matches and losing three with the latest being a 34-15 demolition by champions KCB at the Lions’ den in Ruaraka. The Deejays sit in eighth place with 11 points—a far cry from the past two seasons where they have reached the semifinals. “ It was disappointing to lose to KCB in the manner that we did. We gave them too much respect and we did not play to our strengths and knowing them, they always capitalise on the situation and punish every mistake you make,” he added. Homeboyz beat Mwamba 22-18 and Menengai Oilers 31-28 but lost 20-12 to Nondies. They, however, lost to Quins 35-15. Odongo added there will be no room for error once the fixtures resumed in the new year. “We need to go on good run if we are get to the playoffs and contend for the big prize later in the season,” he added. Odongo was confident his charges would turn around their season despite the sluggish start. “I have confidence in the boys and we can move up the log although we need to be consistent and reduce our error rate,” he added. Odongo said the boys will be put on a personalised training regimen for the Christmas and New Year holidays to ensure maximum fitness and conditioning before the fixture. “We will keep the boys on toes during the festive season and we hope they will come back at peak levels.” Odongo said the league is competitive and they have no choice but to punch above their weight. “ There are no easy teams in the league. Look at the results that teams like Mean Machine and Menengai Oilers are playing. It shows almost everyone is at par in the league and you can not underestimate anyone,” he noted. Homeboyz face Blak Blad next on January 12, Nakuru (January 19) and win-less Strathmore Leos on January 26.
