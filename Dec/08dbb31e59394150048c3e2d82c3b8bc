A Catholic church in Mombasa held a cultural diversity fair aimed at fostering inter-ethnic co-existence among communities in the area. Members of Holy Family Catholic Church Kiembeni Parish on Sunday danced to cultural tunes as traditional foods were served symbolising celebration of diversity. The parish priest Vincent Alicho said cultural diversity should be embraced through such festivals. The event’s theme was ‘Healing our tribes in Christ’. Alicho said the country should not plunge into tribal animosity during political campaigns due to ethnicity. He asked religious leaders to unite communities and foster peaceful coexistence. He called on Christians to pray against the scourge of electoral violence. “We know how things become when elections approach. We saw tribal animosity due to the different political affiliations. To end this, we have joined hands and decided to bring our tribes together through exchanging our cultural activities in the church,” Alicho said. He said the cultural affairs in the church showed that communities should coexist and not accept to be divided. The chairman of the church parish John Andiwa said matters of peace in the country should not be left to politicians alone, adding that the church should take up the mantle and provide leadershiop.
