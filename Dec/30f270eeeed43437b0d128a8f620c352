Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka says the Deputy President’s position is a “hot seat” and the holder is constantly under attack because one is a heartbeat away to the presidency. “I was the 10th Vice President but we have had only four presidents. Being a Vice President or Deputy President is really a slippery business. When you hold that office, you are severely fought, pulled down, dragged all over and all other dangerous episodes just to bar you from inheriting the presidency, but this time round we will deliver,” Kalonzo said. He promised Kenyans massive political realignment, which he said would usher in a new phase of leadership. He said although the 2022 debate is healthy, Kenyans should not be preoccupied with it. The Wiper leader said those ethnicising the fight against corruption should be “forgiven” but the president and the institutions charged with the mandate must not relent.
