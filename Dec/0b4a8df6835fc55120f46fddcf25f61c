Kenyan champions Telkom will launch their bid to reclaim their Africa Cup for Club Championship title against Ghana Police when the 30th edition tournament gets underway in Abuja National Stadium, Nigeria today. Telkom fell by a solitary goal to Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) in last year’s championships, ending their quest to a 10th continental title. Jos Openda’s side, who retained the domestic league without dropping a point will look to carry the same form into the tournament and recapture their continental glory after which the long-serving coach will step down. Telkom played their opponents for the day to a one-all draw in last year’s tournament and had registered a similar margin in the 2015 final, before the Kenyan queens prevailed 3-1 on post match penalties. At the same time another Kenyan representative USIU-A Spartans will make their debut at the event against Nigerian side, Delta Queens. Spartans made it to the tournament after finishing second in the just ended Kenyan season and will hope to get inspiration from the success of their compatriots Telkom. Defending champions GRA begin their title defence against Kada Queens of Nigeria.
