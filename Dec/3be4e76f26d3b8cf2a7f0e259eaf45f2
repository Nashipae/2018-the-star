A mosque built on a disputed piece of land in Kambe Bondora in Kilifi county was yesterday demolished by police officers. Police officers arrived in the morning at the site with an excavator and pulled down three structures – the mosque, an orphanage centre and a residence – on the half-acre land. Two families — that of Juma Ali and David Mwamutsi – are fighting over the ownership of the land. Last Friday, more than 300 Muslims protested the impending demolition, saying they have been in that area for more than 40 years. Human rights activist Emmanuel Chengo, who witnessed the demolition, describe the scene as “very bad and disheartening”. “This is an issue which could be settled by the two families without necessarily pulling down a place of worship,” Chengo said. Mohammed Kazungu, an Ustadh at the mosque, said the two families should have spared the mosque. “We should be preaching peace, instead of doing things that will bring about hatred. Demolishing a place of worship will obviously anger the Muslims,” he said. On September 13, Chief Justice David Maraga appointed a five-judge bench to hear and determine the notice of motion dated May 28 over the land.
