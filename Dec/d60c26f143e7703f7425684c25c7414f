Nairobi county has zeroed in on five companies as it picks the contractor for the Sh20 billion Dandora Waste Energy plant. Environment executive Larry Wambua said out of the 26 companies shortlisted, five are being evaluated. Only the firm with the most advanced technology and financial capacity will be awarded the Sh20 billion tender. “We are committed to ensure the project kicks off and right now. We’re evaluatingto ensure we have the best company incorporated,” he said. The plant will recycle waste and use garbage to supply electricity in the city. It is expected to produce 160MW of clean, renewable energy daily. The plant will also eliminate mountains of waste in Dandora and create jobs for youth. Wambua said the county is working around the clock to salvage the Dandora dumpsite that is overflowing. Some of it has been compacted. Illegal dumpsites are a major problem for waste management efforts, he said. “We have made arrests and soon the Korogocho illegal dumpsite will be turned into a park,” he said. Other illegal dumpsites are in Kayole, Embakasi South next to English Press. The Dandora dumpsite covers more than 30 acres and receives most of the waste, including waste from nearby estates such as as Kariobangi, Baba Dogo, Maringo and Korogocho. More than 2,000 metric tonnes of garbage are dumped in Dandora every day.
