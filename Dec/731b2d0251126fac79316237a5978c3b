The Nyamira county Assembly Budget committee has said the county government has never remitted statutory deductions from its employees since devolution. Committee Chairman Richard Onyinkwa said the county could not account for deductions that could amount to more than Sh160 million. The deductions include National Hospital Insurance Fund, Kenya Revenue Authority, the National Social Security Fund and gratuity deductions. The revelation came when the Assembly was preparing to debate a supplementary Appropriations Bill, which was tabled in the House by Onyinkwa on Thursday afternoon. He said non-remitted deductions were among reasons the supplementary budget was needed. The chairman said other major issues include clearing pending bills, reappropriating the County Education Bursary Fund of Sh130 million, contributing to the Lake Region Economic Bloc Development kitty, constructing county headquarters, buying Governor John Nyagarama an official car and paying gratuities of Sh66 million. The budget has been the cause of war between Executive and the Assembly. MCAs have taken a hard line against paying pending bills, which they termed “unbelievable”. The supplementary appropriations Bill was brought forward just three months after the main budget was controversially passed without Nyagarama assenting to it. debate suspended Ekerenyo Ward MCA Thadeus Nyabaro said the budget was unnecessary since the Executive had not implemented even a fraction of the current budget. Even as the budget document was tabled on Thursday, it could not be debated after it emerged that the copies of the document served to MCAs were different from the chairman’s copy. The debate was suspended until the copies were amended. It will be heard on Tuesday. The total amount of the proposed bill was Sh6,898,045,805.
