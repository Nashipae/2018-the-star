A 60-year-old man has been charged with defiling and groping the sexual organs of a 12-year-old orphan. Hadi Said is accused of committing the offense on December 18 at King'orani in Mombasa. He was arrested on Tuesday. He denied the offenseÂ before Mombasa residence magistrate Martin Rabera. The girl lost both parents while still a toddler. The suspect was granted a Sh200,000 bond with a surety of similar amount. The case will be heard on January 8 next year. Meanwhile, the victim is at Coast General Hospital undergoing treatment according to rights group Muslims for Human Rights (Muhuri) who have taken over the case. Muhuri official in charge of gender Topister Juma said the degree of injury is grave. "The girl is traumatised. She will be taken to a rescue centre," she said. This charge follows the jailing of another sex pest, Ngoloma Mulinge, in yet another effort by Muhuri. Mulinge was handed 30 years in prison for repeatedly raping and impregnating a 12-year-old Kisauni girl in 2016. Shanzu Principal Magistrate Diana Mochache said Mulinge deserves no mercy as he had ruined the girls' life. Click here for the latest political news
