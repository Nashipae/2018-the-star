Kenyan Premier League side Kakamega Homeboyz can now forget their financial woes and concentrate on delivering results on the pitch following a Sh15m boost for the County Government of Kakamega. Club chairman Cleophas Shimanyula believes the cash injection provides the missing link to their success and have warned rival teams to expect tough times when the Western Kenya side comes calling. Shimanyula revealed that he was relieved of the heavy burden of financing the day-to-day running of the team and can now work in getting results of his now inspired charges. “It won’t be business as usual after this historic signing of a memorandum of understanding with the County, which will see us establish a formidable side that will challenge football giants both locally and in the region,” said Shimanyula. “Having posted some convincing results against our neighbors Simba FC and Singida of Tanzania, I believe this sponsorship will enable us to attract quality stars that will help us fight and challenge for title.” He called upon his players to remain focused and repay the good gesture by giving all their best through hard work and discipline, starting with their weekend match against AFC Leopards. “We are now happy to roll out our sponsorship with Kakamega Homeboyz after the assembly passed the Sports Bill 2018, which will, among others, see the nurturing and development of talents right from the ward level,” said Minister for Sports, Youth and Culture, Robert Makhanu. “We want to commend Shimanyula and laud him for bankrolling the team single-handedly despite the numerous challenges involved in running a team at a competitive top-level league.
