Adrian Khafafa cuts out as a lad who doesn't fear to express his mind and views on issues around him. It is this spirit that he cultivated in his studies at Alliance High School, hence the A- (minus) score in the just-released KCSE exam. Adrian, the firstborn son of Radio Africa Group manager Martin Khafafa, aims to be an aeronautical engineer. He said the 78 points he earned in KCSE was a continuation of the excellent work at Mount Kenya Academy where he emerged the top KCPE 2014 student in Nyeri county with 425 marks. "I was tense when results were about to be announced. I knew I scored a good grade but didn't know exactly how good it was." "After the results were declared, I was scared of sending a results query to Knec. After doing so, I still took minutes to read the message but was so elated when it turned out well," he told the Star in an interview. Prior to the exams, Adrian, 18, says he "chose to shut his ears to the world's noises" and concentrate on his studies. "I believe in myself and with that, I said I would do my best and get a good grade. Thank God it came to pass." He attributed the good performance to hard work, focus, and support from his parents, teachers, and friends. Adrian says his fascination with aviation started when he was still young. "I had and still have a strong affinity to planes." He told the Star that he has plans to join a flight school in order to get the required certifications. "I will also be taking a short course in International Relations as I wait to college," the youngster said. Adrian’s mother Mumbi Khafafa said the lad has been consistent in his performance. "He has been a diligent, obedient and very respectful son," she told the Star. Click here for the latest political news
