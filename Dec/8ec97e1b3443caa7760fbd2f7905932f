Diamond Platnumz’ father, Abdul Juma, is in critical condition. For the longest time now, the father of the bongo star has been pleading for help to get treatment. Juma says even though his son is ranked as one of the richest Tanzanian celebs, he has gotten no help. "When I started doing interviews, I thought I’d change my son’s stand, who is said to be one of the richest in Tanzania," he told Tanzania’s Mwananchi. "Even though I have a famous son in and out of the country, my life is just like this. I live in a simple house that I believe if ever Diamond gets stuck in life, he will come to live here because this is his home. I ask myself: What wrong have I ever done?" He says the last time he and the son spoke was when the star was dating former Miss Tanzania Wema Sepetu. "They used to come together to greet me," he said. He says he finds it difficult to walk. "Life now is not good. I have a leg problem. Sometimes, I can’t walk a long distance. My leg pains and sometimes, I can’t even get out of bed," he said. The singer's father is said to have been a deadbeat father, who abandoned Diamond and his mother.
