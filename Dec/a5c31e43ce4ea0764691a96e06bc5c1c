Real Madrid and Croatia midfielder Luka Modric was named winner of the 2018 Ballon d'Or on Monday, breaking Cristiano Ronaldo's and Lionel Messi's decade-long hold on the prestigious award. Modric, 33, helped Real Madrid win a third successive Champions League title in May and also captained Croatia to their first World Cup final, being named player of the tournament despite his side losing 4-2 to France. The award, voted for by journalists and organised by French magazine France Football, has been dominated by Messi and Ronaldo since 2008. The last player to lift the award apart from the Argentine and Portuguese, who have won it a joint-record five times each, was Kaka in 2007 when the Brazilian played for AC Milan. Meanwhile, French sensational striker Kylian Mbappe won the inaugural Kopa award during the ceremony held in Paris. The award is given to an under 21 player that has had an impressive year in all competitions. Mbappe was instrumental in helping the France to win the 2018 World Cup in Russia, becoming the youngest player to score in a World Cup. He scored four goals during the tournament and netted a total of 33 times for Real Madrid. The 19 year-old Cameroonian born-French citizen said he looks forward to winning both the Kopa award and Ballon d'Or next year. Meanwhile, Ada Hegerberg was voted the winner of the women's Ballon d'Or. The striker helped the mighty Lyon to the Champions League title this season. At 23, she has already won three Champions League crowns, four French championships and three French Cup titles. Click here for the latest political news
