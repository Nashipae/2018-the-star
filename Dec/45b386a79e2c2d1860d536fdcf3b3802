Kenya Airways yesterday commenced flights to Mogadishu after a 12 year break. The national carrier has contracted Kenya-based Aircraft Leasing Services (ALS) to make the daily flights to Somalia. The flights depart from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport Terminal 2E at 1:00 pm and arrive in Aden Adde International Airport at 2:45pm. The return is schedule to leave Mogadishu at 3:50 landing at JKIA at 5:35pm. The schedule is expected to offer connections to the rest of Africa, Middle Asia and USA through the the international airport. KQ chief executive Sebastian Mikosz said the route will ease travel for thousands of Somalis who live in Kenya and diaspora community traveling to their native country. “Introducing more destination on the African continent is a major development and achievement as part of our strategy,” Mikosz said. KQ suspended its direct flights to Somalia in 2006 due to escalated terror threats and attacks by Al-shabaab. The daily flights were expected to commence on November 15 but this was later pushed to December 5. The flights were expected to be operated by Jambojet on the Bombardier Dash 8 Q400. KQ has previously hired ALS to fly Nairobi to Lokichogio, Turkana route. The partnership with ALS allows provision of aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance.
