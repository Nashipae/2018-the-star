National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale has proposed for a constitutional referendum to create a federal system of government as a way of eradicating corruption. While supporting the nomination of Twalib Mbarak to take over as Chief Executive Officer of Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Duale said wiping out the current presidential system would be the best tool to stop graft. During the afternoon session, the House anonymously approved the former military intelligence officer to take over from Halakhe Waqo for the next six years. Duale said the referendum debate will be revived next year, arguing that the current system is entangled in immense corruption.
