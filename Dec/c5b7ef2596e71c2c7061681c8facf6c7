Retired Judge Philip Ramsley yesterday failed to show up in a London Court where he is fighting his extradition to Kenya. Ransley was arrested by the UK authorities in July and was later granted bail by the City of Westminster Magistrates Court that same month He fled to England via Dubai in June 2016 after he had been charged with stealing Sh102.7 million from Angela Scott and Sh152.7 million from Rowland Minns. On 21 January 2017, the High Court in Milimani issued an arrest warrant against him. The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji sent a letter to the UK authorities requesting Ransley’s extradition in June this year. He was yesterday expected to appear in Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London with his case number clearly displayed at the Court entrance as '1801519719' but failed to do so. However, his Barrister Malcolm Hawkes told the Court that the retired Judge was unwell and on medication. Hawkes told the Court the allegations that Ransley stole his client’s funds were not true and that the judge was a victim. The case was postponed until January 10, 2019. Ransley, 85 years old, embezzled money from client accounts at his law firm, Ransley McVicker Shaw Advocates, that he started in 2007 after retiring from the Kenyan bench. He has been staying in a small flat in Richmond, London near his daughter Candice and her husband Marc Schneider, a former investor in Wananchi Communications. Former estate agent Roland Minns sold his plot of land in Langata through Ransley’s law firm for Sh260 million in 2014. The retired judge delayed remitting the funds to Minns but eventually managed to get Sh105 million. Minns is taking legal action to recover the outstanding Sh155 million. Yesterday the Court heard that talks going on between Ransley and Minns and it was possible that the charges could be withdrawn. Click here for the latest political news
