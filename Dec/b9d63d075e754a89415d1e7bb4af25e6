The Kenya Tea Development Agency has beenurgedto increase its monthly payment to farmers from Sh15 to Sh30 per kilogramme. Murang’a women representative Sabina Chege said MPs from the region have formed a caucus to discuss the issues plaguing the tea sector and fight for the interests of farmers, including better pay for the produce. Speaking on Wednesday during Jamhuri Day celebrations in Murang’a county, Chege said t tea factories sell a kilogramme of processed tea at Sh400 and asked how farmers are paid only Sh40 per kilogramme in annual bonuses. “We know how much they sell tea for at the auctions. That money is enough to pay farmers at Sh30 per kilogramme per month and still pay the annual bonus,” she said. Chege also faulted the agency for delaying farmers’ annual payments by more than one year, which she said resulted in farmers overreliance on loans. KTDA, she said, started a micro-finance firm that it uses to give loans to desperate farmers, turning them into slaves. The lawmaker said the MPs’ caucus will discuss how KTDA should pay farmers and ensure farmers do not continue suffering. “We want to tell KTDA that from next near, it will not be business as usual. They have to start paying our farmers better,” she said. Chege also asked the government to consider establishing a tea and coffee ministry. Click here for the latest political news
