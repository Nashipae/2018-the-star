A suspect in the murder of Vioja Mahakamani actor Jamal Nasul will be detained for five days to allow police complete investigations. Grace Kanamu Namu yesterday appeared before Mavoko senior principal magistrate Charity Chebii Oluoch but did not take plea as not charges were read to her. The prosecution requested to detain her for the five days to complete investigations. Oluoch directed that the suspect be detained at Mlolongo police station until December 18 when she will appear in court. Defence lawyer Cliff Ombeta asked the court to allow his client seek treatment. The request was granted. “The suspect should be taken to hospital for treatment,” Oluoch said. Namu was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly stabbing Nasul, her boyfriend, to death. A police report says Namu allegedly stabbed Nasul at Arks Hotel on Tuesday night after a quarrel. A Good Samaritan called Athi River police station and made a report at about 6.15am the following day. It was recorded under OB No 08/12/12/2018. “Nassul ( 39 ), was having a party at Arks Hotel near 67 Airport Hotel. There was a quarrel between him and Grace Kanamu Namu (40 ). She picked a knife and stabbed him,” the police report says. Read: Vioja Mahakamani actor Jamal Nassul stabbed to death in Mlolongo Click here for the latest political news
