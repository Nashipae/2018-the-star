Kimilili MP Didimus Barasa has asked Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati to stop his county inspectorate from harassing traders while they carry out their businesses. Barasa said he has been irked by how the council askaris keep on chasing away small traders, arresting and taking their groceries in the name of collecting taxes. Addressing residents at Katiba grounds in Kimilili town on Saturday, the MP said Wangamati had promised in his campaign pledges to exempt mama mbogas and small-scale traders from paying taxes. "I did not elect myself as an MP but was elected by Kimilili people whom I shall fully defend whenever they are harassed and that why I want to tell Wangamati that he should warn his askaris from harassing my people," he said The MP promised to construct modern kiosks for the traders so that they may operate in a clean and hygienic environment. ‘I have a lot of plans that will improve these women’s lives and I have told them that we shall take their names down so that we construct new stalls for them as the next year begins,’ he said.
