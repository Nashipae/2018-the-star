Leaders implicated in corruption should own up instead of taking cover behind their tribes, Budalang'i MP Raphael Wanjala has said. He said the ongoing corruption purge is not targetting any particular community. "No government officer has been employed on the basis of tribe or ethnicity,” Wanjala said. He addressed the press after launching the Bunyala football tournament at Siagonjo Stadium, Budalangi subcounty, on Monday. Wanjala cited Sirisia MP John Waluke, who was charged with fraud in August in relation to an alleged million dollar contract between Chelsea Freight and the National Cereals and Produce Board. He said it's Waluke the individual who has been implicated, not the community he comes from. “From December 18, this month, we will visit the four wards in this constituency to gather information on projects, whose funds have been misused and present the report to the DPP in January for further investigations,” he said. Wanjala urged youths to engage in sports to earn a living.
