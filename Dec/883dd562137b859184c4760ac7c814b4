The Mwingi North CDF committee has been told to resign if the pressure is too much and are unable to keep up with the their MP. “I will not condone layabouts or joyriders in my CDF team. All members must be ready to deliver. We must all be on the run to fulfil the covenant I signed with my electorate,” MP Paul Nzengu said. He is the Mwingi North NG-CDF patron. Nzengu spoke at the Mwingi Legacy Hotel on Thursday night when he hosted his CDF members, staff and the constituency office workers for an end year party. He said all CDF members must be dedicated to their mandate if they will make a difference in the lives of residents. “You must ensure all assignments are accomplished with speed. Any person who is not a team player or cannot cope with the speed at which I want things done is free to tender his resignation,” the lawmaker said. Nzengu warned that officials who do not work satisfactorily and are not willing to voluntarily quit, would be forced out. He said he requires people who will help him accomplish his “big agenda” for Mwingi. “I want you to remember that I made a promise to accomplish many life-changing projects in Mwingi North. You are the people I bank on to deliver on my promises,” Nzengu said.
