The government has set aside Sh16 billion to help implement the 100 per cent transition to secondary schools in the form one selection. Secondary schools are set to absorb all the 1,032,334 pupils who sat this year’s KCPE exams whose results were released on November 19. Education CS Amina Mohamed said the funds will help improve the infrastructure of the schools to accommodate the high number of students joining Form One next year. The funds are expected to be disbursed between January 7 to 11 next year. The CS made the announcement at Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) while launching the form one selection exercise on Monday. There has been apprehension among education sector players regarding the implementation of the full transition program especially owing to the infrastructural shortage in schools. Read: 100 per cent transition to secondary school may fail There have been jitters about few classes, dormitories and laboratories in schools. Even with the CS’ announcement of the development vote, the jury is still out on whether the amount is enough. Pressure due to increased student numbers is also expected when it comes to the learner to teacher ratio. The CS was silent on how the human resource aspect will be addressed. Teachers’ Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia said the country has a deficit of over 87,000 teachers and challenged the teachers to be innovative in dealing with the pressure. Early this year, Macharia told Parliament’s education committee that Treasury was to blame for not releasing funds to enable the commission hire 20,000 teachers annually to plug the deficit. Amina said the state will cater for 100 per cent tuition fees for day scholars. This is Sh22,244 per year per student. Parents with children in public boarding schools will only be required to top up the fees.
