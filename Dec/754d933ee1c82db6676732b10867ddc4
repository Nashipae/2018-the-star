UK-based Kenyan F3 driver Jeremy Wahome wrapped up his 2018 campaign in awesome fashion racing for Italian outfit — Scuadra Villorba Corsa (SVC). Wahome, who started his motorsport career with go-karts at RVMSC Solai racetrack, took part in the Asian Formula 3 Championship (certified by FIA) where he finished 12th overall. Asked about his plans for the 2019 season, 19 year old Jeremy said: “That’s what we’re trying to figure out now. There’s a lot of changes going on in the European Formula 3 environment, so we’re waiting for confirmations, and of course looking for sponsors... which is quite difficult.” But finishing 12th overall was quite encouraging for the fast-rising Kenyan speedster who aspires to join Formula One ranks upon completing his university education. “Well, that marks the end of the 2018 season. Race 2 was compromised when my front wing came loose on lap 1, but I still managed to hold onto 9th place, and a DNF in race 3. Overall it’s been an interesting year in Asia with a new car, new team, new championship.” “I had to miss Round 2 of the championship because of a visa hitch, but made it for Round 3 in Shanghai and Round 4 in Ningbo, China! It was a new circuit for me with exciting new challenge.” “Generally, I enjoyed racing in Asia and trying out new circuits. A lot of valuable lessons were learnt along the way too. Thanks to the team and everyone who made it possible.”
