The officer told Kiambu senior resident magistrate Brian Khaemba the time will allow detectives to obtain a forensic report on from the Communications Authority of Kenya. The police intend to travel to Wajir and Kakamega counties to arrest more suspects. According to the police, Douglas Mbaya, who is also a blogger, was involved in the circulation of the video of Gedi in a compromising situation with an unidentified man. Mbaya did not take a plea. The suspect is expected to be arraigned in court on January 14 and charged with publishing obscene information in electronic form contrary to Section 84D of the Kenya Information and Communication Act Cap 411A.
