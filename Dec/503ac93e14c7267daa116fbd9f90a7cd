Radio Africa Group CEO Patrick Quarcoo on Friday said Radio Africa will continue investing and developing new media products next year. “We have set up a strong digital team and are making a big investment in new digital technology to expand the reach of the Star, Mpasho and the Radio Africa websites,” he said. Quarcoo said journalists should make extra effort in the coming year to match that investment at a time when the media industry has been under pressure. He spoke during a party to celebrate the contributions of David Makali in his one-year contract as Head of Content for Radio and the Star. The Radio Africa Group includes the Star, the Star website, Mpasho, Classic FM, Kiss 100, Gukena FM, East FM, Radio Jambo, Bamba Sport and Kiss TV. “I thought I would not come back to the media again but Mr Quarcoo called me,” Makali said. His parting advice to journalists was to make every effort to counter the increase in fake news. “Together we learned many things and we continued to build our networks,” Makali said. Radio Africa Group’s Convergence Director William Pike said Makali’s critical intelligence had greatly improved the quality of the converged RAL Star newsroom output.
