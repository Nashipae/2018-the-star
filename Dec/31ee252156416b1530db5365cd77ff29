Poor teaching methods and corruption in driving schools has been blamed for the high number of accidents on Kenyan roads. Stakeholders want the driving school curriculum overhauled. Kenya Association of Tour Operators Coast chair Ishpal Oberoi said teaching using toy cars on boards and making people move from one point to another is not practical. “Where in the world do you learn to drive with a toy on a board?” Oberoi said. He spoke at a meeting with senior officials in the National Transport Safety Authority, the National Police Service at the Coast and the Mombasa Inspectorate officers in Mombasa on Monday evening. NTSA director general Francis Meja said the authority is developing new standards for driving schools and computerised examinations will be introduced. He acknowledged shortfalls in the driving schools which he said the government is addressing. “We want to reorganise the way schools train and test our drivers,” Meja said. The meeting was attended by Matatu Owners Association officials, Kenya Transport Association officials, tour operators, breakdown service operators, truck drivers, traffic police, among other stakeholders. Oberoi said the driving schools should be forced to buy simulators where learners can have the feel of a real car but with no risks. “Simulators are as real as it can possibly be without disrupting other motorists,” he said.
