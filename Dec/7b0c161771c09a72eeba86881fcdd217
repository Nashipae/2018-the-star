Queen’s Counsel Khawar Qureshi was on Thursday seen at the Milimani Law Courts awaiting the trial of Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu. Quereshi who was appointed by Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji was preparing his prosecution against Mwilu. The hearing of the case is about to kick off.

Qureshi will be the special prosecutor in the case where the DCJ has been charged with abuse of office, failure to pay stamp tax, improperly obtaining Sh12 million from Imperial Bank, and obtaining security for a loan by false pretence. A five-bench judge will hear an application by two organisations who sought to join a petition seeking to determine whether criminal charges should be brought against her. In October, High Court judge Chacha Mwita referred Mwilu’s case to Chief Justice David Maraga asking him to empanel a bench of an uneven number of judges to hear and determine the matter. Mwita said the petition raises substantial questions and due to its public importance, it is only fair it be heard by a bench.
