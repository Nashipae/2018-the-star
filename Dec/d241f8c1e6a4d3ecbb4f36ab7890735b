West Pokot governor John Lonyangapuo has asked students from region to take education seriously, saying it is key to development. Lonyangapuo (below) on Monday said the county still lacks critical human resource for innovation. He said education is the only way to change the community’s narrative of poverty and illiteracy. Speaking in Kapenguria, the governor called affirmative action, saying illiteracy levels were still high. He said the county government had doubled bursary kitty from Sh150 million to support students pursuing higher education. Additional funds have also been set aside to sponsor students pursuing special courses. “We want to support our children so that we have a powerhouse of professionals to serve our people,” Lonyangapuo said.
