Deputy President William Ruto will make mincemeat out of Baringo senator Gideon Moi. But 2022 is too far off and new alliances will take shape. The son of retired President Daniel Moi — Gideon — has been making new inroads, reviving speculation about a State House run in 2022. Moi and Ruto come from Rift Valley this is sibling rivalry. In 2022, we are likely to see a repeat of 2002 when Mwai Kibaki and Uhuru Kenyatta were the two formidable candidates, both from the Kikuyu nation. Of late, Moi has been robbing Mt Kenya, robbing ODM leader Raila Odinga, Cyrus Jirongo, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and the rest. Ruto is going for the people in sponsored in 2017. Moi operates from Baringo and is the undisputed leader there, while Ruto controls 95 percent of Rift Valley. Moi seems to have sponsored a few Kalenjin MPs to fight Ruto, especially on the maize scam. Ruto is generous in dishing out money and has a tight network, while Moi has more money by virtue of his father but the problem is that he is less generous. Ruto seems to know that even if he supported Uhuru, there's a likelihood Uhuru will be unable to push t Kenya to vote for him. Moi seems to be a gentleman of Kenyan politics while Ruto is the man who goes for it. Ruto has been categorical that he will crush anybody who poses an obstacle to his ambitions for State House. We are seeing two different personalities We see Ruto the hustler and a man who sold chicken. We see Moi, the son of nobility who believes he is entitled to power. If Moi is on the ballot in 2022, the question is whether Kenyans will go for a hustler who has fought his own battles or retain the dynasty. I don’t think Moi has the capacity to challenge Ruto. The only difference will be State machinery. Who will control it in 2022? The political analyst and lawyer spoke to the Star Click here for the latest political news
