The Director of Criminal Investigations has ordered a probe into the attack on the seven-year-old son of a senior state prosecutor by a pack of dogs at a Naivasha camp. The victim’s father Joseph Riungu said the attack occurred on November 28 at Crayfish Camp where his son and other schoolchildren had gone for camping. He said the boy was attacked and seriously injured by five German shepherd dogs in the compound. Speaking to the Star, Riungu said he has reported the matter to the DCI who has directed DCIO Naivasha to take over the case from Kongoni police station and carry out investigations. The DCI wants the proprietors of Crayfish arrested and charged with the offence. Crayfish restaurant manager Anthony Sifuma in response said it was an accident and the camp is responsible for what happened. “We have offered to pay the hospital bills  and cater for other related costs,” Sifuma said adding that the matter is under investigation by the office of the DCI. Riungu described the proprietors as influential individuals. His son is a student at Marion Preparatory school. Riungu  has obtained a P3 form from police and said his son and a teacher from the school who had accompanied the boy have recorded statements. “This impunity and negligence on the part of Crayfish Camp hotel proprietorship must be exposed to protect other children from being viciously attacked by the uncontrolled German shepherd dogs.This is purely criminal negligence under Section 23 of Penal Code,” Riungu said. It is popular with both domestic and overseas tourists who go there for boating, nature walks, wildlife spotting, mountain biking, horse riding, picnicking and indoor games. Click here for
