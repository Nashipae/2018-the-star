Budding actor Simon Kumbe is slowly making his way into the acting industry. The Eldoret-based actor has been shooting a series of videos, with the latest one being a Christmas movie. He hopes that come New Year, he can get a platform to showcase his work. "I love acting but have been facing financial challenges," he told Word Is. "But recently, award-winning gospel singer Papa Dennis came through to help me. He has offered to sponsor my shoots and I hope next year, I will be able to get a TV station that can air my videos." The determined Kumbe added: "In future, I would like to work with Pascal Tokodi and Papa Dennis as actors in my movies."
