There is grumbling among artistes signed under a popular Kenyan gospel record label. The issue is that the owner, a controversial gospel singer, has squandered all their hard-earned money from mobile ringback tunes. One artiste claims the star bought his wife a house, yet he lives in a Sh7,000 house that doesn't have running water and a toilet. This is because he is paying his artiste peanuts, although he has garnered his fame through them. Recently the record label signed a female artiste, who, due to the manipulation by the boss, left after recording one song. The boss of the record lives a flashy lifestyle that is depicted on social media. Recently, another artiste from the label threatened to leave and the boss said the label would delete their songs if they did. The artistes signed contracts making him the owner of their creative work.
