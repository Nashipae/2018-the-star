KNEC chairman George Magoha has asked children to abstain from taking money from their parents to buy fake exam papers. "Please allow your brain to work, and even if the help to cheat comes from your blood relative, tell them to go to hell." Speaking during the release of the KCSE 2018, Magoha said the government made great milestones in curbing exam cheating. "The children have gotten what they deserved...children are not guilty...It is the parents and unscrupulous teachers who give the children the money as a form of love," he said. During the exam period, more than five KCSE candidates were deregistered by the Kenya National Examination Council and discontinued from sitting the exam on charges of cheating. Education CS Amina Mohamed said the candidates were caught with "foreign material and documentation" in examination rooms ahead of Mathematics Paper 2. Six persons, said to have masterminded exam cheating in the country for years, were also arrested and are still in remand.
