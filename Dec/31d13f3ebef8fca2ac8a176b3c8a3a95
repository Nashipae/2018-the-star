One of two protesters shot during a demo in Sirisia constituency on Thursday succumbed to injuries. Residents of Malakisi town had taken to the streets to protest after a man was fatally shot by policemen during a crackdown on illicit alcohol. The group lit bonfires and blocked roads as they marched to Malakisi police station demanding justice. George Lumbuku was treating guests to a local brew during December festivities when police stormed the house. He tried to run away, but police caught up with him and hit the back of his head with a gun. Lumbuku's father, John, said, "My son has never wronged anyone and I'm calling for justice." Residents torched the house and office of the Butonge assistant chief whom they accused of sending officers to Lumbuku's home. Sirisia politician Moses Nandalwe condemned the killing and asked Bungoma county commissioner James Kiandaa to probe the matter. Sirisia OCPD AnthonyÂ Njeru said he is waiting for the results of a postmortem. He said that officers had gone to arrest revelers drinking chang'aa. "I will not defend any cop who will be found to have done any wrong. He will face the law," Njeru said. Click here for the latest political news
