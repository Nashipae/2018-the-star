National Super League debutants Eldoret Youth savoured victory for the first time since their promotion when they beat St Joseph Youth 2-0 at Kericho Green Stadium. Eldoret lost their first match 3-1 to FC Talanta but made amends yesterday as a goal in either half ended their wait to first victory in the second tier league. Anthony Chingwa gave Eldoret the lead in the 30th minute before Kevin Cheti, who scored their consolation goal against Talanta, doubled the lead in the 53rd minute. Shabana tasted victory as they downed a visiting Nairobi City Stars side 1-0 at Gusii Stadium. Oscar Oketch was the hero of the match as his second half goal proved the difference at full time.   Administration Police downed Coast Stima 3-1. Meanwhile, women football has been given a new impetus following the graduation of teachers and grassroot coaches at the conclusion of a week-long coaching course. The sports teachers and coaches were drawn from various primary schools and grassroot women’s teams in the coastal region. The participants were taken through basic coaching, as well as the Laws of the Game under the tutelage of FKF Lead Instructor Twahir Muhiddin.  They were thereafter certified by Football Kenya Federation’s Technical Department. FKF President Nick Mwendwa, while gracing the closing ceremony at the Royal Court Hotel in Mombasa, emphasized the federation’s commitment to women football development.
