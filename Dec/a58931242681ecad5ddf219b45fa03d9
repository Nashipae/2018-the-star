A bright and needy student from Ijara, Garissa county, can now see a bright future after National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale came to his rescue. Duale has committed himself to pay the entire school fees of Mohamed Abdifatah during his four years in secondary school. The story of Abdifatah, who sat for his KCPE exams at Hara Primary school, scoring 390 marks, was highlighted by the Star this month. After his impressive results, he was selected to join Nairobi School. Abdifatah, the first born in a family of seven, appealed to well-wishers for  financial assistance for his school fees next year at the top national school. His father, Ahmed Abdifatah, a watchman at a hardware store, had told the Star that he could not afford to pay for his son’s school fees with the meager income. However, Abdifatah’s dream to continue with his education and become an engineer can now be realised. Yesterday Duale presented his father with a cheque covering next year’s fees. Duale also promised to take him shopping and buy his uniform. The Majority leader also facilitated transport from Ijara to Nairobi where he presented the father with the cheque. ENGINEER Abdifatah and his father, who could not hide their joy, thanked Duale for his generosity. “I really don’t know what to say because I am overwhelmed with joy. I want to thank the Majority leader and may God bless him. The future looks bright for my son and my family,” Ahmed said. Abdifatah promised to work hard in his studies and utilise the opportunity granted to him. “I want to promise that I will work hard in my studies to become an engineer and help my family and society. I cant wait to join the school of my choice,” he said. Speaking in his office in Nairobi, Duale said that he was pleased to empower the young man realise his potential, help his family and his country.
