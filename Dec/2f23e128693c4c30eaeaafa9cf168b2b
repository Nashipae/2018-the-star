A clean-sheet against an experienced continental outfit like Asante Kotoko is something to be proud of, Kariobangi Sharks captain Geoffrey Shiveka has said. The Kenyan representatives in the CAF Confederations Cup were held to a barren draw by the Ghanaian side in the first leg of their first-round tie played on Saturday at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Coming on the back of a 9-1 win on aggregate over Arta Solar 7 of Djibouti in the preliminary round, Sharks dominated possession in search for an ambitious win, but resolute defending from the more experienced guests saw the match end 0-0. “Obviously, we wanted to win the game and give ourselves a good chance of qualifying for the next round. We are disappointed not to have won but a goalless draw is not the worst result in the world and our performance gives us encouragement that we can go to Ghana and do something special,” said the defender, who produced a resolute performance with his new central defensive partner, Tom Teka. “Our understanding as a partnership is improving and will only get better. Defending is all about the whole team starting from the strikers upfront. We all did our job in regard to protecting our goal and we have to focus on doing the same going forward,” he added. William Muluyas charges will thus hope to make a better show in the return match slated for Saturday in Ghana. The winner on aggregate gains qualification to the playoff round, which is the final qualifying round to the competition’s group stages.
