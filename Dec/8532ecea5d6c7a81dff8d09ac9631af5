Champions KCB have made five changes ahead of Kenya Cup clash today against Mwamba at the Lion’s Den in Ruaraka. Head coach Curtis Olago is expected give former Homeboyz and Kenya Simbas’ fullback, Tony Onyango, who will start on the wing. Simbas internationals Moses Amusala, Andrew Amonde, Darwin Mukidza and Peter Kilonzo will get the nod to start the game after the bankers lost their 20-match unbeaten run to Nondies last weekend, losing 27-22. Tight head prop Curtis Lilako is also available for the clash in what is a bankers’ derby against Mwamba as Olago recalls his big guns for today’s encounter. Olago has also made tactical changes in the back row with Rocky Aguko shifting to blindside flanker from number eight and Peter Waitere starting at open side flanker. Amonde starts at number eight. Olago will be seeking to bounce back from the defeat to Nondies and expects his side to respond. “We did not play well last week so we have made a couple of changes to freshen up the squad and give ourselves a chance of bouncing back to winning ways,” he said. Olago said with the unbeaten streak is over, it has taken the pressure off the team. “Everybody wants to beat us and so far, we have not brought our ‘A’ game yet but going forward, you will see a very improved and clinical performance from us,” he added. Olago said he expects a competitive contest from Mwamba, who have lost their two opening fixtures 29-26 to Quins and 22-18 to Mwamba. “Mwamba will be going for win. They have had very close losses and we must be at our best to stop them,” he added. Quins entertain Homeboyz at the RFUEA ground and will be aiming to bounce back after an upset 14-8 loss to Oilers last weekend. In other fixtures, Nondies face Oilers as Impala host Strathmore Leos in a double header at the Impala Club. Early pacesetters Kabras Sugar have a date with Nakuru RFC at the Kakamega show ground.
