Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati has refuted to claims that he is supporting Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. Speaking during a live interview on Sulwe FM - a local vernacular radio station, the governor said that he supports Moses Wetang’ula’s presidential bid. He said on Wednesday that the Ford Kenya national executive council endorsed Wetang’ula to fight it out with other presidential candidates in the 2022 race. "Claims that I support the Dp Ruto are far-fetched. As Luhyas, we have no stake in Ruto’s candidature. Those supporting him have their own personal interests," Wangamati said. The county boss said that he attends Ruto’s functions in Bungoma county because the latter is the deputy president. "And as a county, we want development in our region. That is all. We shouldn’t mix politics and development. It is too early." Wangamati said that he only prayed for Ruto’s candidature at Christ the King Catholic Church in Bungoma a week ago but at no time did he say he was supporting the DP's candidature. "As Ford Kenya, we will engage any presidential candidate in a structured way in case we think of a coalition. At the moment, Wetang’ula is our candidate," he said. He said Luhyas cannot afford to be in the opposition after the 2022 elections, hence called for support to the unity course initiated by the community's leaders. A section of Ford Kenya politicians, among them deputy party leader Boni Khalwale, have openly endorsed Ruto's State House bid. The move has not been received well with ANC party whose leaders had plans to merge with Ford Kenya. Ruto is expected in Bungoma again on Sunday to attend the homecoming prayer ceremony of Sirisia MP John Waluke. Click here for the latest political news
