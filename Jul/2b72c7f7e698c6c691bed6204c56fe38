Amani National Congress is strengthening its grassroots structures ahead of the proposed merger with Ford Kenya, chairman Kelvin Lunani said yesterday. Party leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang’ula plan to collapse their parties into one strong outfit capable of bringing the Luhya vote into one basket in 2022. The party secretariat has been holding consultative meetings with branch executives in all 47 counties. It wants to replace officials who  left after the August 8 General Election.  The party has also launched membership recruitment. “We went to the August polls when the party was about two years old. This affected chances of our party leader Musalia Mudavadi clinching the NASA flag bearer post. We want to avoid that in future,” Lunani said on the phone yesterday. He said the party is positioning Mudavadi as the strongest presidential candidate for 2022. Lunani said the ongoing reorganisation of the two parties does not mean the merger has collapsed. The members want to ensure the new outfit will be built on strong structures. Lunani is a member of the merger technical committee. He said a comprehensive report on the merger will be ready by the end of September. Lunani said Ford Kenya is also re-branding. He added that Mudavadi will camp at the Coast for a week starting July 12 to consolidate the party base and consult local leaders on the merger. ANC secretary general Barack Muluka said the technical committee on the merger agreed on the  new party structures and who the presidential candidate will be. “We have concluded the matter, but I am not authorised to make the announcement. The final disclosure will be made by the two leaders,” he said on June 20 in Kakamega.
