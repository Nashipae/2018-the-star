In August, Nairobi will play host to huge stars. Already, it has been confirmed that Keri Hilson, Big Shaq, Horrace Brown, Bobby V and WESTRN will be in town for the Terminal Music festival. Now two more stars will be headed our way. King of slow jams Kenny Lattimore is expected in Kenya on August 3, where he will thrill fans at the Kasarani Indoor Arena. Lattimore has just released a new album called ‘Vulnerable’, which “accurately describes where I am in my life right now,” he said in a past interview. He is known for hits like Never too Busy, Days Like This, For You, Stay On Your Mind among other RnB ballads. The celebrated Grammy award nominee boasts of 10 studio albums. Meanwhile, there is chatter that one half of P Square, Mr P, could be contracted for a concert in Kenya. He could be the headlining act in the upcoming edition of United Sounds of Africa. Mr P, whose real name is Peter Okoye, may be headed to Nairobi soon. He is currently on his European tour, titled, “All Eyes on P”. The star is riding high on the music charts with his new release titled, Ebeano, in which he has featured his son, Cameron Okoye.
