The Court of Appeal has reinstated Bowen Kangogo as Marakwet East MP, saying he was rightfully elected. Kangogo's election was nullified by the High Court after voter Sammy Kemboi said the August 8, 2017 vote was not transparent. On Thursday, however, a three-judge bench led by justice Erastus Githinji ruled that claims of massive irregularities and illegalities were not proved. "There was also no evidence that the final results may have been interfered with," Githinji said. The judges also dismissed findings by High Court judge Kanyi Kimondo that two unregistered polling stations were used on voting day. Kangogo defeated former MP Linah Kilimo by about 1,000 votes He appealed the lower court's decision, arguing that it relied on unpleaded evidence to nullify his election. He also said there were no irregularities in the election. During celebrations after the ruling, the politician thanked the electorate saying he would not have made it into office without them.
