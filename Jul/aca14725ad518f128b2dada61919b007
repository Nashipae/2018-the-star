Leaders and residents of Kipipiri are demanding answers following postmortem results that revealed the chief of Malewa, Paul Karugu, was killed before his body was dumped in Kimuru River. They want the government to expedite investigations and ensure the killers are brought to book and their motive established. Karugu’s body was found in the river two weeks ago. Karugu’s body had a deep cut in the back of his head. It was initially suspected he fell at the nearby bridge while walking home. But during his burial at Daraja Mbili village in Malewa on Friday, Kipipiri police chief Charles Rotich and assistant county commissioner Robert Ng’etich told mourners the postmortem results indicated his death was not an accident. They called on residents to volunteer information. Kipipiri MCA Paul Ngeche and his nominated counterpart Wangari Methu said there are questions which remain unanswered.
