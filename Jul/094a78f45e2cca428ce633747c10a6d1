Francis Mburu wants the High Court to declare unconstitutional investigations being carried out by the EACC into the disputed Ruaraka land. He says the basis of the commission’s probe is solely informed by ulterior motives and premised on malicious falsehoods peddled by whistle-blower Meshack Dehay — now a state witness. In documents filed in court yesterday, the director of Afrison Export and Import Limited claims Dehay is a well-known extortionist, an ex-convict and a criminal, who, after a failed attempt to extort Sh82 million from him, fabricated allegations against him, his co-directors and business associates. “The government has acted irrationally by relying on exaggerated and misleading complaints and facts from a well-known extortionist, a criminal and ex-convict,” Mburu argues.

But Mburu maintains he acquired it in 1981 and “a competent court whose final order is absolute” determined its ownership. He argues the commission, in disguise of investigations, requested his lawyers — the custodians of title documents of LR NO 7879/4 — to submit the title documents for forensic investigations with an undertaking that the process would take an hour. After submitting the documents, they were surprised by a correspondence that the process would take an indefinite time and the documents would be retained, he said.
