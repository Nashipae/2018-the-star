The government is set to establish a new medical training college in Kajiado. Kenya Medical Training College chairman Philip Kaloki said the new school will supplement existing facilities across the country. After a meeting with Kajiado Governor Joseph Lenku on Tuesday, the KMTC boss said plans are underway to establish a national medical college within the next year. Prof Kaloki said the national and county government, in conjunction with other development partners, are in talks over the project. For the Kajiado project, he said the county government will provide land and build classrooms while the national government will provide the technical personnel to run the school. "Already, there is a medical training college in Loitokitok that is training nurses from all over the country. The one we will put up in Kajiado town will take at least 30 per cent of the local students," Kaloki said. Lenku said the Kajiado KMTC will also strengthen the county's referral hospital in terms of the training nurses. Kaloki was accompanied by top officials among them KMTC acting CEO Michael Kiptoo.
