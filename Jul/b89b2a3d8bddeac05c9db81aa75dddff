Two students of St Marks girls secondary have been remanded at Eldoret Juvenile after they were unable to raise Sh000 cash bail or Sh200 000 bond. The two form three students were charged with attempted arson at a Kitale court. They were arrested on Sunday over an attempt to commit arson. “We received calls from the school that some students had attempted to burn down a dormitory in the morning,"Trans Nzoia East police boss James Mwangi said. He said the students poured petrol on the walk and entrance of the dormitory on Sunday morning when colleagues were still asleep. They were caught in the act. He said that the officers recovered about a litre of petrol within the school compound. Trans Nzoia leaders have at the same time called on the government to address the real course of school infernos instead of prosecuting students in the affected institutions. Woman representative Janet Nangabo, Kwanza Mp Ferdinand Wanyonyi and Senator Michael Mbito took issue with the current approach by the government to contain the unrest in schools. “I want to differ with the KNUT secretary general Wilson Sossion that the unrest has been sparked by the ongoing school principals delocalization process by TSC, this not a good enough reason but the government needs to dig deeper and find the solution,” Nangabo said.
