The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji yesterday said he is not opposed to a plea bargain deal in the trial of Busia governor Sospeter Ojaamong (pictured) and eight others. Haji however said there were no plans to negotiate because none of the accused had made the approach.

We have supplied documents to the accused, and we are ready to proceed with the trial” a state lawyer told chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti. Click here for the latest political news
