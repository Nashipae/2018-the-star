The monthly revenue at the Mombasa port has hit an all-time high of Sh45.5 billion, according to data by the Kenya Revenue Authority. KRA’s daily revenue proportion report shows that as at July 30, KRA recorded the highest ever monthly revenue collection from the port in the last two months. With two days to the end of the month, revenue collection stood at Sh45.5 billion. This has been attributed to increased efficiency over the past few months. Former National Construction Authority CEO Daniel Manduku took over as KPA acting MD two months ago. The average monthly revenue is usually about Sh30 billion. The KPA management targets 1.3 million containers to pass through the port by the end of the year. Last year, it recorded 1.1 million containers. On Sunday, KPA head of container operations Edward Opiyo said they continue to attract more ships. He spoke during the maiden call of the MV Ever Diamond, which is of 294.13 metres in length. It is among the largest ships of the world. “The arrival of the vessel — operated by Evergreen Shipping Line — is significant. It shows we’ve been attracting more business due to increased efficiency. We’re optimistic that we’ll surpass the 1.3 million containers this year,” Opiyo said. “About a week ago, Ever Dynamic, another ship operated by Evergreen Shipping Line made 1,422 moves per shift, which is the highest ever record. We hope this vessel will also break that record.” He said KPA has invested heavily on equipment and infrastructure to improve services. These are parts of the measures put in place to transform the facility s it can realise better returns, he said. “We now move seven standard gauge railway cargo trains to Nairobi daily. We plan to increase the number to eight next month,” Opiyo said.
