Two dormitories which house 100 students at Chulaimbo Boys Secondary school, Kisumu county were razed down on Saturday. Boarding Master Maurice Okuku said the fire started at 9.15pm when the students were in their classes for preps. Okuku said they heard a loud bang, and on checking found out that one of the dormitory (Owira) was on fire, which later spread to Omino dormitory. He said the students and the community helped to fight the fire. He told the Star that they still don't know what might have caused the fire because there was no tension or unrest amongst the students. "The students were in class as always, everything was calm in the school, this is pure arson," added Okuku. A section of students corroborated what the boarding master said saying they are still shocked and wondering what might have caused the fire. Currently, the school board of management is meeting with the Principal and deputy to decide on next cause of action. However the county deputy governor Mathews Owili expressed concern of what has been witnessed in the schools within the county for the last few weeks. He said the incidents were unfortunate and will on Monday meet with the county education heads to know what is causing the unrest and find an amicable solution to this. This is the fourth school in Nyanza to experience unrest in the last one week. On Friday, Kisumu girls high school was closed after the girls went on a rampage destroying the schools' property, smashing windows including their principal vehicle.
