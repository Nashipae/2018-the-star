Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti yesterday ‘disappeared mysteriously’ from Parliament where he was to shed light on the Moi Girls School Nairobi rape case and schools unrest. The secretariat of the National Assembly Education committee said Kinoti was spotted within Parliament Buildings but was unavailable when MPs wanted to ask him about the progress of the investigations. The committee chaired by Tinderet MP Julius Melly criticised Kinoti for not honouring two invites. “This is bad behaviour from a government officer. We are investigating a serious matter because children were assaulted. We have waited for him for two hours and he is nowhere to be found,” Melly said. Nominated MP and Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion called on Kinoti to resign. The MP said he has failed to be accountable to Kenyans. Click here for the latest political news
