Machakos youth leader Frasha has started his campaign against alcohol abuse. Today will be his fifth day since he started the 40-day alcohol-free challenge, and he believes it is all a question of willpower. He told Word Is: "I have been doing the challenge every year. So when Nacada board member Chipukeezy talked to me about trying to help curb the rise of drug abuse in the country, I found it necessary. "A lot that young people, especially in Machakos, are taking cheap liquor, thus affecting their lifestyles. I therefore want to stand in as a role model." Frasha, who is also a musician, said police should crack down on drug abuse because the situation is "getting out of hand". "Basically, I want to show our youths that one doesn't need to go to rehab to fight drug abuse. You can stop if you want to. And being a family man, I also want to set a good example," he said. Frasha said he only drinks when he is with his friends, and he can quit it completely. "I drink and sometimes stop because I am just a social drinker. Do not allow alcohol to control you. Instead be the master of it," he said. What people do not know about Frasha is that he interacts a lot with God when he is not drinking. "When I stop drinking, it is always my fasting days. I become very spiritual and interact a lot with God."
