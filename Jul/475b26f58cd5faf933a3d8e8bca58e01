Health staff from Bomet have given Governor Joyce Laboso one week to release their June salaries or they go on strike. Kenya National Union of Nurses Bomet branch Secretary Vincent Rono said nurses have not been paid for one month. He said there was no communication from the county government over the delay. “The staff have always known that at the end of every month they are getting their pay, but it is saddening that no one has come out and explained to us what is really happening, everyone is mum,” Rono said on Friday. He warned that should their concerns not be addressed within the next seven days, they will down their tools. Rono wondered where some senior officials at the county are drawing funds for ‘miscellaneous’ purposes while ignoring the nurses’ plight. Deputy Governor Hillary Barchok said the pay for all county staff is being processed. “Probably next week our staff will be receiving their salaries,” he noted. Health executive Joseph Sitonik said, “We are yet to receive a formal notice from the health staff, but the best people to answer an issue of salary delay are the finance team.”
