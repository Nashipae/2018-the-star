An Ol Kalou trader was yesterday overjoyed after learning that an indigenous tree planted by Kenya’s founding President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta 66 years ago would not be cut down. David Wanjohi, commonly known as Elnino, on Friday caused drama in the central business district. He protested against the tree being brought down by a contractor who is upgrading Ol Kalou town. He also prevented a second indigenous tree he planted in honour of Nobel Peace Laureate Wangari Maathai from being cut down. A monument of Mzee Kenyatta might be built near Wanjohi’s shop. Nyanduarua Governor Francis Kimemia said the county was considering erecting a monument during beautification of the town. He said the two trees would be protected. “I have been informed there is a Kenyatta tree here in Ol Kalou. People almost fought over it. I have told the contractor not to cut it. There is also another tree planted in honour of Wangari Maathai. I made a stopover in town at 9pm last evening and saw them. Those trees must be protected,” Kimemia said on Saturday. The governor said the Kenyatta tree has a history. He told the county Environment executive Simon Ng’ang’a to ensure the trees are nurtured since residents value them. Wanjohi said the governor’s idea of a Kenyatta monument is great. He spoke to the Star. “That is good news. People visiting Ol Kalou usually like resting here,” Wanjohi said. He said he would rather die than see the Mununga tree (Ekerbergia capensis) destroyed. Mzee Kenyatta planted it prior to his arrest by colonialists and eventual detention in 1952. Wanjohi planted a Pondo tree in October 2011, the day environmentalist Maathai was cremated.
