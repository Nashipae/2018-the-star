Former national Under-19 football champions Kakamega High’s ‘Green Commando’ have landed a tough opponent in today’s semis at Hill School, Eldoret. The Green Commando, who are tutored by Brendan Mwinamo, drew 1-1 with Nyanza’s Ringa in their last group match to book a date with Nairobi’s Dagoretti. Kevintom Machika put Kakamega ahead in the 18th minute but Aaron Nyagaka leveled the scores in the 73rd. The second semifinal tie will pit St. Anthony’s Kitale and Olbolsat. The boys from Trans Nzoia County side advanced to the semis unbeaten after tallying seven points by hammering Kathungi 2-0 in their third pool fixture. Chrispinus Wekesa and Moses Mudavadi were St. Anthony’s talismen, netting in the 42nd and 50th minutes respectively. On the other hand, Dagoretti settled for a goal-less last group fixture with Shimba Hill as Olbolsat thwarted Tarbaj 4-1 to advance. Dagoretti High coach Joseph Makokha said between yesterday and today, he only needed to have his charges maintain focus to deliver. “It is not an easy tie but the boys are determined to record a win and get to the finals. Kakamega are a formidable side and we can not afford complacency at this juncture,” he said. Meanwhile, Noel Oruka, Felistus Atieno and Ivy Chepkurui netted one goal each as debutantes Moi Girls Nangili beat Materdei High 3-0 to cruise to the girls’ Copa Coca Cola Under-16 semi finals. They meet defending champions Olympic Mixed. Waa Girls settled for a barren draw against Tartar Girls for the former to book a place in the semis against 2016 holders Wiyeta. In the boys clashes, Riyabu High won 2-1 against Sabunley to advance to the semis where they meet St. Anthony’s. The second semis will pit St. Peter’s Mumias and Upper Hill though the latter lost to St. Anthony’s 2-1, while the former hammered St. Cyprian 4-0 in their last pool match.
