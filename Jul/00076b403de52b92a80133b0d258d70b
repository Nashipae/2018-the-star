Some residents of Kibera are moving back to their villages to avoid being evicted from their homes to pave way for road construction. A vacation notice issued by the state for the construction of a link road between Ngong Road- Langata Road expired yesterday. Kenya Urban Roads Authority, National Lands Commission and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights yesterday toured the area. A team of surveyors will today start putting beacons and recording affected residents. The visit follows a meeting between the three agencies last Tuesday that forestalled a planned forceful eviction. It was agreed that residents compensated for their businesses and houses and not land which belongs to the state. Residents were moving out yesterday, others said they had found houses elsewhere while some said they lacked cash. Tom Mogosi, who has lived in Kibera since 1983, said his house also doubles up as his shop. “I cannot continue staying here. I better go home and start life a fresh. My neighbours have all left. I know only community leaders and the people with connections will be compensated,” Mogosi said. About 30,000 people will affected. Several schools, churches and homes will be demolished. National Land Commission vice chairperson Abigael Mukolwe said the Kibera land that measures about 650 acres belonged to the state until 2016 when 288 acres was allocated to the Nubian community. The road will cut 60m wide from the DC’s office north to Kibera South Health Centre before proceeding to Kungu-Karumba Road. It will have a 2.5m wide cycle tracks on each side and pedestrian walkways. In total, 10 acres will be used for the link road. Kenya Urban Roads Authority communication officer John Cheboi said only 600m of the road land is occupied by the residents. Resident James Mogire said he had lived in the slum since 1990. Residents said the map showing where the road would pass has been changed three time since 2014, when the plan was conceptualised.
