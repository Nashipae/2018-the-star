Kitui East MP Nimrod Mbai (pictured) has said President Uhuru Kenyatta was misled into appointing Monica Juma Foreign Affairs CS. The first-time MP said the President was duped because she neither has a heart nor interest for Ukambani. He said the Kamba do not have a connection with the Jubilee administration because they were overlooked in key appointments. “As Kamba leaders, we feel we are not represented. Monica Juma, who is said to be our representative, has shifted her interest to Murang’a county,” Mbai said. He spoke to the Star on the phone on Sunday. Mbai said, “She was born in Gilgil, went to school in Gilgil and got married in Murang’a. She knows nothing about Ukambani.”
