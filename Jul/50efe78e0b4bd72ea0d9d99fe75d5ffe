Nationals Sevens circuit received a shot in the arm yesterday with Telkom Kenya forking out Sh4.2 million. The circuit that started last weekend with the Prinsloo Sevens in Nakuru continues this weekend with the Sepetuka Sevens in Eldoret. Each of the five hosting clubs will receive Sh700,000 from the deal. Speaking at the official announcement of the deal at the Telkom Plaza, Kenya Harlequins chairman Mike Lucas on behalf of the six host clubs, reiterated the pivotal role of corporate sponsorship in growing Sevens rugby locally and internationally. “We are excited with the entrance of Telkom as a sponsor for this year’s National Sevens circuit. With corporate sponsorships like Telkom’s guaranteeing the game’s growth, the potential to dominate the sport on a global stage in the near future is realistic,” he said. Telkom CEO Aldo Mareuse said the sponsorship will act as a launching pad for long term partnership with rugby. “We are confident we will see demonstrable value in the circuit to grow our investment in the game. We are cognisant of the importance of corporate sponsorship and involvement to Kenyan sport. We have seen first-hand with our other sponsorships, what sports packages can do to the economy when utilized well,” said Mareuse. The telco aims to replicate its success by backing continental hockey heavyweights Telkom Ladies Hockey team and former world javelin champion Julius Yego.
