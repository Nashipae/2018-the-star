On Monday students at Chalbi High School in Marsabit beat up and chased away six non-local teachers. Hostility to non-locals in government institutions is widespread across north-eastern Kenya. But the region lacks sufficient educated local people to do every job. Government is trying to reduce the marginalisation of huge under-developed counties like Marsabit, Wajir and Garissa. Unavoidably, educated non-locals are needed to help. There is a shortage of teachers in the Northeast and the Teachers Service Commission has been pressurising non-local teachers not to run away after terrorist incidents. What should those teachers do if they also come under attack from students? And what will those students achieve in the future if they receive a shoddy education because of a lack of teachers? The leadership of these counties – governors, MPs, senators, county commissioners, chiefs – need to explain to their people that non-locals are needed to close the development gap with other counties. Non-locals should be welcome, not rejected. And violent students should be arrested and jailed if they are over 18 years. Quote of the day: "Love is three quarters curiosity."
