MCAs in the Lake Region Economic Bloc have been urged to approve a bill to give it authority to transact business, chairman Wycliffe Oparanya has said.
Oparanya, who is the Kakamega governor, on Tuesday said the laws will give the 14-member bloc a legal backing.
“This will give the bloc an executive green light to have an allocation in line within our county budgets so that we can fund its activities,” he said.
He said the bill will be introduced before all the 14 county assemblies soon for approval. The Bill requires any six governors to sign any agreement to be binding to the rest. The bloc brings together Trans-Nzoia, Kakamega, Bungoma, Busia, Vihiga, Kisumu, Siaya, Kisii, Nyamira, Nandi, Kericho, Bomet, Homa Bay and Migori counties, which have an estimated total population of 14 million.
Oparanya said 12 of the 14 governors had signed the legal instruments of agreement establishing the bloc.
Migori and Homa Bay are yet to sign the agreement. Trans-Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba, who has been reluctant, signed the deal on Monday in Kakamega. Two weeks ago, Oparanya was invited to address the Homa Bay assembly, who had apposed to the allocation of Sh200 million for the bloc’s proposed regional bank.
