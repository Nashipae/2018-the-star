Deputy President William Ruto has directed that the Export Promotion Council be merged with Brand Kenya in the government effort to streamline the sector. The DP raised concern over the slow pace at which Kenya is broadening its export product hence setting a stage for a national export strategy. Ruto said that in 2017, only five categories of products accounted for 56 per cent of all the countries export products and 13 countries bought 70 per cent of what was on offer. He asked the Ministry of Trade to make the appropriate measures to ensure that the role of export promotion council is streamlined to match up the new national strategy policy. Ruto, however, lauded the council stating that it had done a great job in marketing the country's products. "We therefore need a solid plan to broaden our export base in order to find new more rewarding markets and mostly brand our products appropriately," Ruto said. He was speaking during the Kenya Trade Week at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC), Nairobi county. Click here for the latest political news
