Policy gaps and lack of diversification are holding back Kenya's target of achieving a 25 percent export quota
yearly, according to participants at the second Kenya Trade and Exposition week. They said financial sector hurdles such as the interest rate caps are retrogressive to trade,
since it slows down uptake of credit. In the
agricultural sector, participants said the government should increase incentives to promote value
addition for global markets. Participants hailed the government's Big Four Agenda as a great initiative but said there should be a coherent plan which involves all relevant players to sustain it for the next four years. Trade CS Peter
Munya said the government will support the Big Four agenda by negotiating
opportunities for market access and coming up with solutions for non-tariff
trade barriers that hold back export trade. He said
despite great blueprints, Kenya hardly implements this due
to cross-purpose communication between  government and private sector players which hinders instead of facilitating implementation. Industrialisation
PS Betty Maina said Kenyan exporters need to go beyond
the 13 countries that are currently destinations for 70 per cent of the country's exports. Economic consultant
Bernard Kagira, said the country needs to plan for economic growth with exports
in mind, to seal the trade deficit estimated at Sh1 trillion. ‘’Products
should also be diversified from the traditional coffee, tea and horticulture,
to service export including health and medical tourism, recreational exports, education,
finance among other neglected sectors,’’ Kigara said Tiku Shah,
from horticulture special economic zone in Naivasha asked government to ease
movement to new markets by speeding up passport acquisitions, visas and enable
opening up of new destinations for traders
