Newly appointed Nzoia Sugar Company board chairman Joash Wamang'oli has asked local leaders to keep politics out of the milling firm. He regretted some local politicians have politicised his appointment at the company. Wamang'oli, who was appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta last Friday to chair the board for the next three years, said his priority is to ensure farmers are paid and not in politics. He told the Star on the phone that the problem Nzoia is experiencing is also being felt by other government-owned millers, and that he does not see why people claim he performed poorly during his last regime. ''We are having problems in the sugar sector. Nzoia's woes are not my making,'' he said. He warned those who planning to lock him out, saying they will not succeed. "I am not the appointing authority. It is the President who appointed. Let them respect his decision,'' he said.. Farmers have not been paid since April, while workers have not received their salaries for the last two months. Wamang'oli said he will meet the President this week to find the way forward in saving the sugar miller.
