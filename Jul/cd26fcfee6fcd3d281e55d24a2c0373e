Sixty-eight students whose property was destroyed in a night dorm fire at Mokowe Mixed Secondary School in Lamu West last Thursday have been sent home to buy new items. The school administration said the 68 lost everything in the fire whose cause is yet to be established. The school administration estimated that Sh7.5 million worth of property was lost in the fire. Among the items the students have been asked to replace are mattresses, metal boxes, school uniforms, shoes and other personal effects. The mixed school has 393 students. Some are boarders and others day scholars. Lamu West education officer Josphat Ngumi yesterday said the students are expected back in school on Tuesday. “The school remains open. The few who were affected have been sent to buy new effects and report back to school on Tuesday, but learning goes on,” he said. Ngumi urged people to stop speculating about the cause of the fire until investigations are complete. Meanwhile, more than 200 students of Witu Secondary School who had been sent home after they went on a three-day hunger strike to protest against bad food at the school are expected back on Monday. The students had refused to eat or learn for three days. The administration sent them home for a week, fearing for their health and probability the situation would escalate.
