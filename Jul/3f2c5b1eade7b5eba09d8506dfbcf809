Cooperatives want President Uhuru Kenyatta to play a role in the delivery of the Big Four agenda. Co-operative Alliance of Kenya CEO Daniel Marube yesterday said the movement needs access to loans with a longer repayment period to enable Kenyans access housing, food and health services. “A lot of land owned by cooperatives is lying idle, but if we are facilitated by the government through provision of road networks, sewerage services, water, and electricity to these areas, building of homes for Kenyans will become efficient and fast,” he said. Commissioner of Cooperatives Mary Mungai said they expect to work with the department of national housing to access the government mortgage finance scheme. The government has received seed capital towards this scheme, with up to Sh30 billion from World Bank and Africa Development Bank. She said the introduction of tax on shareholder dividends for sacccos will discourage the savings culture that is enshrined in cooperatives’ values and should be scrapped from the Budget. Kenya loses up to 30 per cent of its harvest to losses in storage, perishability, and lack of access to markets. Last year, Sh150 billion worth of food went to waste as over 1.9 million tonnes of food was thrown away, according to government data.
