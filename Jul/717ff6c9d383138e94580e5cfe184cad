About 20 al Shabaab militants yesterday morning attempted to ambush an AP camp in Amey, Liboi, but were repulsed. Garissa county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng’ said the terrorists struck at 2am, but police officers kept them at bay. He spoke in his office yesterday. “We have information that the militants have been planning to attack the camp, and other key installations along the border town,” he said.  SAFARICOM MAST DESTROYED The commissioner denied some officers were injured during a heavy gunfire between the them and the militants. He said no officer was missing, since all were accounted for. “No firearms were stolen, and the terrorists did not take away a police Landcruiser as alleged,” Chepchieng’ said. The commissioner said the militants partially destroyed a Safaricom mast, which has weakened mobile phone communication in the area. “We have dispatched officers to reinforce the camp and pursue the attackers. We also have an helicopter doing aerial surveillance and supporting the ground teams,” he said.  TERRORIST TARGET CARS The militants have been targeting police patrols, camps and the Safaricom mast in their attacks along the border. The mobile service provider Safaricom was repairing its masts in Ijara that was extensively damaged late last year following assurance that security had been beefed up. North Eastern regional commissioner Mohamud Saleh previously said security for the masts would be enhanced. He said they should be erected close to security camps.
