A former KWS ranger was charged on Wednesday with threatening to kill his former bosses after dismissal from service. Vincent Ocharo is accused of threatening human resources officers including Lynette Muganda, Wilson Mulwa and Joseph Nyongesa in a Facebook post on July 4. He was arrested after the complainants, who were tagged in the post, reported the matter at the Lang'ata DCI office. The threat was retrieved and printed, and is among exhibits to be presented in court. Ocharo allegedly wrote: "Whoever knows the persons below, tell them to be aware that I will find justice through any means ... it's happening soon. I will not starve while you are feeding your family ... I am coming for you and I am ready to go to jail. You can't do this to me [sic]. "I think it's time you know that I'm a trained and armed person. I will not cry again. #Nyongesa, Mulwa and Muganda,  I am your personal enemy. Unless I am served justice, I'm ready to rot in jail [sic]." It was shared on Kilimani Mums and Dads Censored Kenya Facebook groups. Ocharo denied the charges before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi and was released on a bond of Sh500, 000 or a cash bail of Sh300,000. The case will be mentioned on August 6 and heard on August 22. The prosecution has lined up eight witnesses including the complainants. Click here for the latest political news
