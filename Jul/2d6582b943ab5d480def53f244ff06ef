Knut boss Wilson Sossion has said the government is transferring teachers to kill the union. Sossion on Saturday said the government should stop the delocalisation by September 31 or they will go on strike. He wants affected teachers returned to their former schools and the more than 30,000 teachers who have advanced their education promoted. The Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary general also wants performance appraisals and contracts stopped. Sossion condemned the annual payment of teachers’ professional development fee worth Sh22 billion to the Teachers’ Service Commission. He said Knut was not consulted in making the decision. “This idea of delocalisation was hatched in 2015 after our successful strike. A report showed teachers sustain strikes because they work close to home,” Sossion said. He added that to call off the boycott, the government has to stop choosing to which hospitals teachers should go under the medical scheme. Sossion demanded that the implementation of the education curriculum be suspended until all stakeholders, including the unions, are fully consulted. He faulted the introduction of the Labour bill, which says for any public organisation to go on strike 75 per cent of the members have to endorse it. Sossion spoke at the Urban Primary School during the Knut Embu AGM. The secretary general said delocalisation is meant to kill the teachers’ unions to completely stop teachers’ strikes. Sossion said international labour laws encourage individuals to teach in their localities and in their languages. He said delocalisation will destroy education since teachers who are not locals will not effectively communicate with the leaners and the parents.
