Parents have urged the Education ministry to form an audit team to estimate the value of property destroyed in school unrest. National Parents’ Association chairperson Nicholas Maiyo yesterday said some boards of management take advantage to defraud parents by inflating the costs. Last week, the ministry said the government will not pay for property damage caused by student riots and arson. It told parents to prepare to pay for repairs. Currently, school principals and boards of management conduct an audit on the amount of property destroyed before each parent is informed of the sum to pay. “Whenever there is unrest, school managements overprice damages. They burden parents,” Maiyo said. He proposed that the ministry conduct a damage assessment before establishing the amount parents would pay. “Such fires are by a small number of students, but end up hurting even the innocent. There should be a security apparatus that can provide evidence of perpetrators to save the innocent,” Maiyo said. Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion blamed the government for overlooking school security. “Let the government instal CCTV cameras in all public schools to ensure safety. This will be essential in ensuring prevention of rampages. But in case of a rampage, those involved can be held culpable,” he said. So far, at least 46 schools have experienced unrest and 142 have been students arrested as suspects. Maiyo said the association supports the proposal to abolish boarding schools to reduce or end chaos. The Education ministry submitted the proposal on Thursday to the National Assembly Education committee. It has yet to determine the cost of property destroyed across the country. Knut says 29 schools have experienced melees. Click here for the latest political news
