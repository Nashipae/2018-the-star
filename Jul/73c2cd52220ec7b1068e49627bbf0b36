Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission officers yesterday raided the Wajir Roads department offices. They confiscated laptops, desktops, files and crucial documents in the four-hour search. The officers did not speak to the media after the operation. Northeastern anti-corruption boss Japhet Baithalu told the Star on the phone his officers were investigating allegations of misuse of public funds. “We did a search after getting a warrant from the court. Officers took away documents to assist in the probe,” he said. Baithalu did not reveal the amount of money that was allegedly misused. However an anti-corruption officer who requested anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media said the amount in question is Sh100 million. “We want to establish the criteria used to pay the money. We suspect that due process was not followed. Whoever is found culpable will face the law,” the officer said. This is not the first time the anti-corruption sleuths have conducted a raid in Wajir. In April, the officers raided the Finance department to investigate allegations of lost funds. Early this week, they summoned two senior county officials for questioning at the commission’s Garissa offices.
