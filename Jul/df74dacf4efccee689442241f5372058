The Constitutional Court in Uganda has cleared the way for President Yoweri Museveni to stand for a sixth term if he wants to. It upheld a constitutional amendment, approved by parliament in December, to scrap the presidential age limit of 75. Museveni, who is 73, has led Uganda for more than 30 years. One of the judges said that citizens still had the power to vote him out. It is not yet clear whether President Museveni will seek re-election in 2021. There was formerly a limit of two five-year presidential terms but this was removed by parliament in 2005. Click here for the latest political news
