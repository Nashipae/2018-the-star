The ban on Shisha shall remain in force, the High court has ruled. Justice Roselyn Aburili, in a ruling on Wednesday, said that lives of Kenyans are more important than the losses incurred by businessmen who deal in Shisha. However, judge Aburili faulted former Health CS Cleopa Mailu for flouting the procedural rules when he issued the notice banning Shisha. She directed them to comply with the rules in the next nine months. Aburili had in January 15 declined to suspend the ban after two suits were filed challenging the health ministry's decision.
