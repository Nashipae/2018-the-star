Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho on Monday dismissed Deputy President William Ruto's forays in the coast saying his 2022 run is "doomed". Joho said he will work with Ruto's opponent as a strategy to ward the DP off coast votes and consequently scuttle his plans. This followed concerns that Joho was losing the region's hold in the wake of Ruto's attempt to woo the region's leaders to back his presidential bid. Some ODM-allied MPs, notably Malindi's Aisha Jumwa, have stopped backing the Governor's 2022 ambition in favour of Ruto. On May 3, Joho held a joint press conference with Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, who is Ruto's political opponent, and promised to unite the country.

"They are clutching on straws for survival," the governor said, adding that the politicians have found a soft target in Raila and are capitalising on it for political survival. He castigated leaders "who think that since they are rich, they can trample upon anyone as long as their ideals are followed." "Mtu anaona opportunity ya TV na gazeti na kuanza kuchezea wakenya. This is the cadre ya unongozi ambayo tuko nayo... mtu ambaye anajiona yeye ni mdosi sana na he believes akisema kitu, wakenya watafuata tu, ama akisema, ni ukweli. Siku hizi wakenya wako informed; watu wanaelewa." (Someone is using the TV and newspapers to fool Kenyans. This is the cadre of leaders we have ... someone who thinks he is rich enough for Kenyans to follow blindly. Kenyans are informed and understand issues). He added: "Unfortunately some of them wanatafuta soft target. Anaweza kuangalia kama ni Joho, wacha tumlime ndio tu 'aokoke'.. 'hamuokoki', kama ni wa kufa, ni wa kufa tu. How do you drag Raila Odinga into the Mau politics?" (Unfortunately some of them (politicians) are looking for soft targets. They can pick Joho hoping to survive (politically) ... you will not survive. If you are doomed, you will remain ill-fated). The county chief issued the remarks when he opened a High Dependency Unit at the maternity wing of the Coast General Hospital. Rift lawmakers led by Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) and MPs Johanna Ng’eno(Emurua Dikir), Beatrice Kones (Bomet East), Nelson Koech (Belgut), Ronald Tonui (Bomet Central), Joyce Korir (Bomet Woman Rep), Gideon Kosgei (Chepalungu) and Bomet Senator Christopher Lang’at linked Raila to the evictions.

Joho, in this regard, said Ruto's camp has lost focus and "it is a waste of time to consider them". The ODM deputy leader further said any corrupt leader claiming he or she will win an electionâ€‹ will fail. â€‹"Let us unite and block corrupt leaders from taking office in this country. Some are normal thieves who walk around claiming they are saints. A thief remains a thief and can't be defined differently."
