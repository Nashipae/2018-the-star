A Bomet church fundraiser was disrupted on Sunday when Jubilee MCAs supporting Deputy President William Ruto engaged in a shouting match with Kanu supporters of Baringo Senator Gideon Moi. The function at Sotik came to a standstill for 30 minutes. Gideon, the chief guest, was present along with Kanu officials were present. Ruto was not. Gideon and Ruto are rivals. Ruto has declared his presidential bid,  Gideon says he’s only focussed on development. On Sunday he said he didn’t want conflict.

One by one, they urged Gideon to shelve presidential ambitions and give Ruto a chance to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. They said it was clear Ruto was way ahead and the community should rally behind him. Alfred Langat (Singorwet) was cut short by church members who said MCAs were wrongly using the event to settle political scores. Langat retorted, “A politician will always be a politician and we have every right to preach and we must tell one another the truth. We are all in Jubilee, including you (Kanu) but we are simply telling you, Gideon, that we only know William Ruto at the moment.” A participant told Langat, “This is a church function. We never came here to politick.” The function stopped for half an hour as people became unruly but there was no violence. It took the intervention of presiding ACK Bishop Charles Ngeno to restore order. Ngeno stopped the other MCAs, Ruto’s supporters, from speaking, saying that in the interests of time, “You will speak another time.” Also present were Kanu secretary general Nick Salat and Tiaty MP William Kapket. When they rose to speak, the leaders accused the MCAs of trying to hijack the event and disrespect the church. Also see: Machakos MCAs condemn Mutua’s attacks on DP Ruto Click here for
