The government will revive the collapsed Flourspar Mining company in Kerio Valley to create jobs. Mining CS John Munyes yesterday said a new investor has been identified to take up the firm which collapsed more than three years ago. Elgeyo Marakwet Deputy Governor Wesley Kiptoo said the county will ensure the company is revived soon to improve county revenue. Munyes and Kiptoo met leaders and community representatives from Kerio Valley. They discussed a compensation row affecting 4,300 people. They were displaced in Kerio Valley to pave way for mining. “We will speed up resolution of the compensation issue so that a new investor can come in the next few months,” Munyes said. He added that the region still has Flourspar deposits that can last more than 33 years. The company went under due to lack of markets, especially in Europe. National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri said there are no clear records on whether any payout has been issued. Swazuri said the families were displaced from 9,000 acres. The commission will in two weeks establish if the families were paid. Munyes said the matter will be handled fast but carefully to guard against double compensation. The CS and the NLC boss said they will ensure they implement President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive to have the matter resolved. Officers from the NLC have visited Kerio Valley to establish the truth on the compensation, which Munyes said has taken unnecessarily long to resolve.
