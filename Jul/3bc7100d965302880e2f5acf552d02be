Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has ordered an audit of all staff houses in county schools. Sonko said some teachers quarters have been rented out illegally, depriving other teachers of residences. He spoke at the launch of school bursary funds at City Hall on Wednesday. “It has been reported that non -teaching staff and outsiders have occupied the teachers quarters in public schools. I want to direct that the Nairobi compliance and disaster department to carry out an audit for these schools,” said Sonko. He said those illegally renting out their official houses make about Sh10,000 every month. “The teachers quarters should only belong to teachers employed in that particular school. The rest should be evicted without failure,” Sonko said. Lands and Housing Executive Charles Kerich urged the public school headteachers to acquire title deeds for their schools. “It is very important for schools to have the title deeds because it will hinder landgrabbers and private developers from occupying their land,” Kerich said. He directed his chief officer to carry out a census in all county public schools to know how many teachers’ quarters have been occupied. Nairobi chief security officer for compliance Tito Kilonzo said the illegal tenants will be evicted. “ If anyone has occupied the teachers quarters they are not teachers, they should move out before we evict them,” Kilonzo said.
