Farmers and directors of the Midland processing plant in Kinangop want the government to intervene for its reopening. They have also asked Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri to offer support so that recently elected directors are registered. Addressing the press in Njabini at the weekend, the directors issued a two-week notice for the registration, failure of which they will take legal action. Director Matheri wa Hungu noted that shareholders held an extraordinary AGM on the January 24 following a court order and conducted the elections. "Our efforts to get a registration certificate [have been unsuccessful]," he said, claiming influential figures may be behind this. “For years, some people with interests in this company have blocked shareholders from getting services so that they can buy it." Matheri said their hopes lay with Kiunjuri as operations at the plant located near Njabini town were at a standstill. The director further noted that the region was experiencing an acute shortage of fertiliser despite promises of supplies by the county government. Former Nyandarua Deputy Governor Waithaka Mwangi said the plant can employ at least 1,000 people and store 18,000 tonnes of potatoes. He also noted that the company is fully owned by local farmers who invested millions of shillings into it but have not received matching returns. Mwangi faulted county leaders saying they had failed to end the crisis that threatens to derail activities at the Sh1 billion processor. “The national government should also play an active role in ending squabbles which have affected tens of farmers from this area,” he said. Speaking in a different forum, however, Governor Francis Kimemia said his government had allocated 520 bags of subsidised fertiliser to every ward in the county. “The county has set aside Sh100 million for the plant. This will go a long way in assisting farmers who do not have markets for their produce,” he also said. Click here for the latest political news
