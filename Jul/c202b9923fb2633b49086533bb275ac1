General Electric has come under investor pressure over its Sh50 billion investment in the Lamu coal plant ( see P15). GE is reportedly reconsidering its decision to take up shares in Amu Power which will operate the plant. Its future is now in doubt. China decommissioned over 100 coal power stations last year because of their negative environmental impact. Some reports say that Lamu will get a refurbished secondhand power station from China with only new turbines and boilers supplied by GE. Should China be exporting its pollution problem to Africa? And this coal station will not even provide cheap power. Kenya does not have a projected power deficit in future and geothermal and wind can easily bridge the gap at a cheaper price. Kenya will have to buy South African coal for 30 years using precious foreign currency. If we want a coal power station, why don't we put it in Ukambani to use Kenyan coal from the Mui basin? The Lamu coal power station is a bad project. Government should scrap it.  Quote of the day: "Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them."
