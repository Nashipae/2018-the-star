Leaders in Garissa want an MP they did not name and attackers who killed three people in Elderre on the border with Isiolo arrested. Burale Dekow, Mohamed Farah and Abdi Derow were killed on Friday while herding their camels. Three other people sustained gunshot wounds. Garissa Senator Yussuf Haji, Governor Ali Korane, MPs Abdikarim Osman (Fafi), Abdi Shurie (Balambala), Sophia Abdinoor (Ijara) and MCAs pointed an accusing finger at the lawmaker. The leaders blamed him for inciting residents. They spoke at Masalani town on Saturday. Haji said it was unacceptable for armed militias to kill innocent people over issues that can be resolved amicably. “We can’t allow people to take the law into their own hands. We will pursue this matter to the end and ensure the people behind the killings are arrested,” he said.  PEACE MEETING CALLED Korane said the MP’s utterances sparked the violence. “As leaders, we need to be careful with what we say in public. We should champion peace and not sow seeds of discord. There is no benefit in people fighting and killing each other, he said. Abdinoor said politicians should let the state address border feud. She urged the government to address the row swiftly. The leaders asked the National Cohesion and Integration Commission to investigate the MP. A peace meeting involving the warring communities has been called on August 8. The border dispute has claimed hundreds of lives, and a lot of property has been destroyed on both sides. In March, the Senate Security Committee said it would push for the approval of the County Boundaries Bill to help end disputes across the country.
