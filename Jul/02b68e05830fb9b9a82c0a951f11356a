It’s all systems go as Muthaiga Golf Club prepares to host the fifth and final Pro-Am qualifier of the forthcoming KCB Karen Masters.
The Muthaiga round of ‘KCB Road to the Masters’ will be used as a yardstick to ascertain the last six qualifiers to the KCB Karen Masters Pro-Am. The Karen Masters, which makes its debut in the Sunshine Tour on its second edition, becomes the country’s second biggest golfing extravaganza after the Kenya Open which is a round of the European Challenge Tour.
So far, 24 golfers —six each from Ruiru, Limuru, Eldoret Club and Nyali have already confirmed their slots for the Karen Masters Pro-Am with the last batch of qualifiers set to be named at Muthaiga. Those who failed to make qualification slots in the past four events have a chance of savouring the ‘once in a lifetime golfing opportunity’ on homestretch. Among the staff golfers expected to grace the weekend showdown include KCB’s Paul Russo, Lawrence Kimathi, Sam Munyua and Peter Mwaura.
Mwaura, who is incidentally the captain at Ruiru Sports Club, won the staff prize in Limuru to book an early slot to the Pro-Am of Karen Masters.
KCB group marketing and communications director, Angela Mwirigi, said the bank is committed to nurturing golfing talent across the country.
“KCB Road to the Masters’ series presents the greatest opportunity for any golfer and we are excited as a bank to increase our participation at this year’s event.
What’s more, we envisage giving hundreds of golfers an opportunity of playing alongside Sunshine Tour professionals.”
At Muthaiga, overall winner, men’s winner, guest winner, staff winner and lady winner will get automatic slots at the Pro-Am of the KCB Karen Masters that tees off at the Par 72 Karen Country Club on July 17. The main event will take place from July 19 to 22. The KCB Karen Masters was officially launched on May 30 at Karen Country Club a few weeks after Sunshine Tour technical gave the course a clean bill of heath.
