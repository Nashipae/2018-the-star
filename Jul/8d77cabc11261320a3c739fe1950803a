KICC managing director Nana Gecaga has been elected deputy chairperson of the International Congress and Convention Association–African chapter for a two-year term. ICCA is an international body representing the world’s leading suppliers in handling, transporting and accommodating international meetings and events. It comprises 1,100-member companies and organisations worldwide. As the deputy chair, Gecaga will work with her colleagues in the ICCA -Africa chapter to position Africa as a prime business conferencing destination and showcase the potential of the continent to host big events. Commenting on her new role, Gecaga said she will use the influential post to further position Kenya as an attractive destination for conference tourism, also known as Meetings, Incentives, Travel, Conferences and Exhibition tourism. “Key will be to showcase Kenya and the continent’s capabilities to host large conferences and events. Africa is ready to do business with the world. With the right in-country partnerships, member countries are able to host major events, and as ICCA-Africa chapter, we will work to ensure we raise this profile,” she said. She said event organisers need to work with the right people and suppliers, who are ICCA Africa members. The Africa chapter's objectives include increasing Africa’s market share of the global meetings industry, extracting more business between countries on the continent, growing and nurturing the people within the industry, and creating a positive image about Africa as a unique and inspiring destination for international meetings and events .
