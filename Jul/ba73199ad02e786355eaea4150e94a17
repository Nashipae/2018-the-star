Investigations into the Sh8 billion NYS scandal will be completed before the end of the year, DPP Noordin Haji has said. Haji said his office is going slow on the probe to ensure they have a watertight case that will lead to conviction. “The investigations on NYS started before I took office and it has so far taken six months but we are hoping to close the case by end of this year,’Haji said. Speaking on Citizen TV on Thursday, Haji also revealed he had returned the Ruaraka land file to the EACC for further interrogation. He said the NYS suspects are answering charges on the loss of only Sh1billion but there is more to do for the remaining Sh 8billion. "The investigation is very broad as it involves many players such as banks and individuals, I'm taking my time because I don't want to fail," he said. He said the call to arrest the first bunch of suspects came after they realised that more funds would have been lost if the suspects had remained in office.

On the prosecution of some banks involved in the scandal, Haji said they will be let off with a fine of only Sh1 million. "I will be seeking amendment for stiffer penalties," he said. On the Ruaraka land saga, Haji assured Kenyans that Cabinet secretaries and anyone involved in the land saga will be arrested. He said that there was a case to answer by those mentioned hence the need to tie some loose ends.
