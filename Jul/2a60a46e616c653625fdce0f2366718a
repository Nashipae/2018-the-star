The proposed Naivasha industrial park has received a major boost after the Treasury allocated Sh700 million for water and sanitation. The project will host a dry port and a standard gauge railway terminus. Water CS Simon Chelugui yesterday said the park will have many factories that will require a lot of water. He said the project will create many jobs. The CS launched the Sh20 million Karunga water project in Gilgil constituency. Some 200 households will benefit in the first phase. Chelugui said construction of the Sh20 billion Malewa Dam has begun. It will serve Naivasha and Gilgil residents.
