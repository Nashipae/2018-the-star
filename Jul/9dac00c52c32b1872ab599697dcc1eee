Kenya Association Manufacturers wants the Kenya Revenue Authority to factor in the cost of Excisable Goods Management System, e-tax service on tax collections. KAM chairman Sachen Gudka said the planned system will push up operation costs and capital expenditures, hence the need to to have it evenly distributed. He said the costs, including the cost of the stamps, should be recovered from excise collections so that no burden is directly passed to the manufacturer or indirectly to the consumer. The digital excise stamp system requires that goods, except motor vehicles manufactured in or imported into Kenya, be attached with Quick Response Codes as security features to block counterfeits, facilitate tracking and enable accounting for locally manufactured goods or imports. The codes will also enable traders and consumers, using smartphones check the authenticity of various goods. The system tracks the excise stamp fees to be paid to the commissioner of revenue by manufacturers and importers of excisable goods based on quantity of stamps issued. Under the system, excise stamp price for instance on cigarettes are Sh2.8 per stamp, mineral water at Sh0.5, wines and alcoholic beverages at Sh2.8, and Cosmetics and Beauty products at Sh0.6 per stamp. The equipment was supplied by a Swiss firm SICPA Security Solutions SA limited at Sh17.7 billion. The implementation would see the taxmen collect Sh3.6 billion in excise tax, while the supplier collects Sh1.2 billion in a month and Sh16 billion in a year. "Manufacturers are not opposed to the EGMS. The practical implementation of the system is where the challenge lies,‚Äù Gudka said. Parliament has recommended that the system be put on hold pending a forensic audit on the contract.
