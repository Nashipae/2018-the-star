Ben Pol, one of the most celebrated Tanzanian vocalists, has responded to Ray C for the first time since she ranted about his performing her song at an event. Pol brought Nairobi to a standstill during the United Sounds of Africa concert—the Kings and Queens edition. The event was in partnership with Songa. The Moyo Mashine hitmaker was last year slammed by the legendary singer after he and Nandy sang her song. Ray C wrote: “Jamaani hii tabia sio nzuri kabisa!!! Sijafa bado! Kama mnaona umuhimu wa sauti yangu kwenye show zenu muwe mnaniitaga basi! Sina cancer ya koo ya kushindwa kuziimba hizo nyimbo!” She warned the artistes. “Nandy hii mara ya mwisho ukipanda fanya kazi zako! Hii mara ya pili ujue! Mashabiki zangu hamuwatendei haki! I don’t like it, sipendi! Maana hata tukigongana muda mwingine hata salam hamnipi kwahiyo staki mazoea.” The Phone hitmaker said he was shocked by Ray C’s reaction. “Nilishang’aa. Sisi tulifanya kwa kumheshimu, hatukufanya kutengeneza pesa. Tulifanya kuwaheshimu wasanii wakubwa ambao walitangulia. I hope baadaye atakua akiona kwamba alikosea.” His take on the Tanzanian Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) summonses to celebrities over nude photos: “Watu wengi ambao wako pale hawajui sana kuhusu art. Sisi tunaandika maoni yetu na tunaomba vitu virekebishwe labda baadaye watakuja kwetu kujifunza pia kwa sababu mambo ya sanaa, hakuna anayejua zaidi.”
