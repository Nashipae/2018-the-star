A Kenyan wants graft suspects granted amnesty and timelines to surrender ill-gotten wealth. Caleb Burudi has petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta to issue a directive allowing all those who have or are suspected to have acquired wealth through questionable means to apply for amnesty. “After making such an application, the offender must surrender to the state the ill-gotten wealth within a specific period as the President may direct,” Burudi says. “Your Excellency, this will give the offenders an opportunity to surrender whatever they acquired illegally to the state,” he said. He said this will ensure quick recovery of stolen money which can in-turn be used in development.
