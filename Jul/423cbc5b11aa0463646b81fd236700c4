The safety of nearly all water dams in the country is not known, a watchdog committee heard yesterday. The Environment and Natural Resources Committee heard there were 4,140 dams and water pans. But only 843 dams are known and regulated, Water and Irrigation PS Joseph Irungu said. “This means 20 per cent of the dams are regulated and 80 per cent are not inspected. This raises serious questions on their safety,” committee member Charity Chepkwony of Njoro said. The committee is probing the safety of dams in the country, following the Solai tragedy. The Solai dam collapsed May 9 killing 47 people. The Committee found out there was poor coordination between the National Environment Management Authority and the Water Resources Authority.

The Kareke Mbiuki-led committee heard the last inspection of Solai dam was done in November 7, 2014. Benjamin Washiali of Mumias East said an inspector who had inspected the Solai had recommended that the Solai dam undergoes “continuous monitoring”. Irungu and his Environment counterpart Charles Sunkuli were at pains to explain the apparent lapse within agencies under the two ministries. “We have a task force formed on June 6 that will help to inform management of dams. The report will be out by August,” Irungu said. Irungu once Water Act 2016, which is new is in place, 2007 laws guiding the sector on how licensing was being done will be updated.
