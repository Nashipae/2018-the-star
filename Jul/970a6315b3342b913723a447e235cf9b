The government has been asked to hasten issuance of title deeds to Chepyuk Settlement Scheme squatters. Chepyuk MCA Franklin Simotwo asked politicians to keep politics out of the process, saying the squatters have waited for the titles for too long. Speaking in Bungoma town on Wednesday, Simotwo said the process will be fair. He said an open verification process was ongoing. The scheme was established in 1971 to settle Sabaots who had been pushed out of their lands by the British during the colonial period. Some Western leaders have opposed degazettment of the scheme, saying the land is a water catchment area. Simotwo criticised the leaders saying their claims were false. “Chepyuk is a settlement scheme. It has not forest land contrary to the claims,” Simotwo said. The scheme is about 4,000 acres. The MCA asked Lands CS Farida Karoney to ensure only bona fide beneficiaries get title deeds. An estimated 8,000 people live in the southern part of the scheme, which is more fertile. The other side is a forest.
