Nairobi and Mombasa remain the top travel destinations among Kenyans, according to a hospitality report. The survey by Jumia Travel also established those between 25 to 35 years travelled the most in 2017. According to the survey, the majority of bookings are done using mobile phones, though some still use computers. Mobile bookings stand at 71 per cent, bookings carried out on desktops recorded 26 per cent, while three per cent used tablets. Head of credit at the Tourism Finance Corporation, Norah Ratemo, said consumers heavily depend on digital platforms for travel information, suggestions and even bookings. Destinations with Wi-Fi, a swimming pool and breakfast were preferred. Fifty-four per cent prefer paying at the hotel, 26 per cent via mobile money, 14 per cent by credit and debit card while six per cent settled for payment using a travel agency. The top five destinations in 2017 were Nairobi at 35 per cent, Mombasa at 30 per cent, Diani at 15 per cent, Nakuru at seven per cent and Naivasha at six per cent. Mombasa and Diani were popular during the end of year festive season and  long weekends. Jumia said Naivasha and Nakuru are usually popular for weekends and some business trips and receive many last-minute bookings. “On the other hand, Nairobi remains the most booked destination for people coming from outside the country as well as from local business people living in other Kenyan cities,” the report said. Jumia Travel country manager Cyrus Onyiego said in 2018, these destinations are still showing a strong lead in popularity, with a growing demand for Kisumu, Malindi, and Eldoret.
