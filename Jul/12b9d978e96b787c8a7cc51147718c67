A man killed himself and his child when he set their house at Siakago police line ablaze on Monday night. His wife, police constable Jane Reluma, 30, suffered 60 per cent burns. She is admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital in critical condition. Amos Lengura had bought petrol and attempted to kill himself and other family members in the fire at 9pm, police said. Mbeere North police boss Jane Sang told the Star on the phone that Reluma spoke from her hospital bed, but was in great pain. She said the woman was responding well to treatment. The husband and child were burnt beyond recognition. Reluma was rescued by neighbours. Sang urged couples to talk and seek help from relatives, friends, elders and religious leaders whenever they have domestic disagreements. “There no need of harming yourself, your spouse or any other family member owing to a misunderstanding. If you disagree, you should seek help and if you find it’s completely impossible to reconcile it’s good to separate,” Sang said. A househelp said Lengura, who is said to have been a land broker in Narok, arrived carrying a jerrican of petrol and he started quarreling with his wife. She said he pulled the wife into the bedroom where the child was and set the house ablaze. A neighbour said that for a long time, the couple had been having disputes. On Monday, four members of a family were burnt to death in Ijara, Likoni, after a fire broke out following a row. Three others are fighting for their lives at Coast General Hospital. Police said a Tanzanian man allegedly started the fire. His wife, her mother, the couple’s son and a nephew perished.
