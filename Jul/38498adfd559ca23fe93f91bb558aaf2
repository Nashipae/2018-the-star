Electoral commission CEO Ezra Chiloba will remain suspended after a judge yesterday declined to grant him relief. Judge Stephen Radido declined to give orders halting Chiloba’s three-month suspension. He said he has not met the legal threshold. Chiloba sought to stop his suspension and have his boss Wafula Chebukati and commissioners Abdi Guliye and Bola Molu held in contempt for locking him out of his office after the court ordered him to resume work. Chiloba wants the court to set aside the decision made by the commission to suspend him. He asked the court to issue a 30-day notice to Chebukati, Guliye and Molu, who purport to constitute the IEBC, to attend court. Chiloba wants the three to show cause why they should not be held in contempt for blocking him from work. The CEO said he will suffer immeasurable prejudice and irreversible violation of his freedoms, rights and due process unless the court hears his petition. He adds that there are only three commissioners remaining at the commission and if indeed a plenary was held on that day as alleged in the letter of suspension, any decision arrived at has no force of law. A minimum of five commissioners are required to constitute a valid plenary. Chebukati swore an affidavit, saying the decision to send Chiloba away was well informed, considering the position he holds. An audit revealed about Sh1 billion may have been lost through flawed procurement of materials for last year’s twin general elections. In the affidavit, the chairman said anomalies unraveled include goods being delivered after the polls, inflated tenders and undelivered goods. Chebukati said the revelations backed the commission’s decision to suspend the chief executive. On July 12, the court issued summons directing Chebukati to appear before it and defend himself against contempt case. He has 30 days within which he can appear in court.
