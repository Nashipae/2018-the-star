An MP from Murang’a county wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to include former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth in his government. Gatanga MP Joseph Nduati yesterday said Kenneth’s development record is “impressive” and he can help propel Uhuru’s development agenda. He said Kenneth was rated the best performing MP during his tenure in CDF usage and his exemplary leadership skills have remained unutilised since his bid to be Nairobi governor failed. “I know the President is looking for efficient leaders to work with in the implementation of the Big Four agenda and Kenneth is a leader we have faith in,” Nduati said. He spoke at Kiunyu PCEA in his constituency. Nduati was accompanied by Kenneth and Murang’a woman representative Sabina Chege. Chege said MPs should emulate Kenneth’s leadership style. She said Kenneth has her support and should boldly visit any part of the country he is invited to. But Kenneth said now is not time to talk about 2022 succession politics. He urged leaders to tone down on politicking and allow government operations to continue uninterrupted. The former MP asked the President to include the fight against corruption in his Big Four agenda. He said corrupt leaders should be punished severely. He criticised governors for asking for immunity against prosecution over graft, terming it “outrageous”. Click here for the latest political news
