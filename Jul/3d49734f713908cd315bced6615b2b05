The Lapsset project has been allocated Sh8.9 billion. The Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport project in its entirety will cost Sh2.5 trillion. Speaking during his first tour of Lapsset at the weekend, East Africa Community and Northern Corridor Development CS Peter Munya said the cash was set aside for 2018-19. He said the extra funds will speed up the project’s completion. The CS said the government plans to inject more money into Lapsset by September. “The government wants Lapsset done in good time, but at the same time, not to compromise on quality. In the forthcoming supplementary budget, we shall also set aside more money,” Munya said. He said the first berth at the site will be completed by December. The other two of the first three berths will be ready in two years. All three berths will cost Sh48 billion. Lapsset chairman Francis Muthaura said measures are in place to ensure the Lamu community benefits from the project. He said the Lapsset project will be a game changer for Lamu, Kenya and the entire East Africa.
