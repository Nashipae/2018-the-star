MPs will use tablets from August to perform official duties during parliamentary sessions. Speaker Justin Muturi said the gadgets will have been installed by mid-August and that legislators will then undergo orientation on their use. In a statement to the House on Tuesday, he said 350 tablets had been delivered and that customised applications had already been installed on 109. "The contractor has undertaken to work overtime to ensure he installs 30 tablets every day and hopes to complete the project by August 16," Muturi said. He said the gadgets will be installed in both the National Assembly and the Senate. Following the development, MPs will receiveÂ order papers, votes and proceedings, committee schedules, the Constitution and statues, Bills, Acts of Parliament, committee reports and other key parliamentary documents in soft copy. Muturi pointed out that the gadgets will also save the environment considering paper is made from trees. "I wish to, therefore, request your patience as the Clerk and his team complete the installations. I wish to assure the House that the gadgets will be user friendly," he said. "I am certain that you will embrace this slight technological interruption." Click here for the latest political news
