Kenyans will pay more for super petrol and less for diesel and kerosene following the ERC's latest review. The Energy Regulatory Commission announced on Saturday that a litre of super petrol will cost Sh3.39 more or Sh112.20 in Nairobi. The price of diesel dropped by Sh0.35 to Sh103.25 and that of kerosene by Sh1.48 to Sh85.94. In Mombasa, petrol will cost Sh108.90, diesel Sh99.96 and kerosene Sh82.94. In Eldoret, a litre of petrol will go for Sh114.05 and diesel Sh105.32, while in Kisumu, petrol will sell at Sh114.12 per litre and diesel at Sh105.39. Motorists in Nakuru will pay Sh112.87 for petrol and Sh104.14 for diesel. ERC Director General Robert Pavel Oimeke explained that the prices, from July 15 until August 14, resulted from changes in the average landed costs of imported products. In the case of super petrol, there was an increase of 5.54 per cent, from $700.01 per ton in May to $738.77 in June. The price of diesel declined by 1.11 percent from $689.62 to $681.99 per ton, while that of kerosene dropped by 1.91 per cent from $745.54 per ton to $731.27. “In the same period, the mean monthly US dollar to Kenya shilling exchange rate depreciated by 0.14 percent from Sh100.87 in May 2018 to Sh101.01 in June 2018,” Oimeke said in a statement. He said the actual pipeline loss factor was calculated at 0.10 percent, less than the standard factor of 0.25 percent. “Accordingly, the savings per litre on account were Sh0.5 for super petrol , Sh0.14 for diesel and Sh0.11 for kerosene.
