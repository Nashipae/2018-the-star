Narok county commissioner George Natembeya has told settlers issued title deeds for land in Maasai Mau forest to surrender them for verification. Natembeya said the documents will be verified before the second phase of evictions kick off. Speaking to the press in his office yesterday, Natembeya said those with genuine title deeds will be compensated or given alternative settlement. “We expect all the people in that area to head to my office to verify they got the documents in the right way. We know there are some people who have fake title deeds,” he said. Natembeya said 8,000 hectares are targeted in the second phase and “prominent personalities are among the 40,000 residents who will be evicted”. “What we are doing is purely government policy and nothing else as portrayed by politicians. The conservation of all water towers was an agenda for the Jubilee administration when tit ascended to power and that is what we are implementing,” he said.
