The Judicial service commission (JSC) has picked Jacqueline Manani as its new representative in the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. Manani was appointed on Monday, for a fixed term of six years, after successful interviews. She previously served as the Director of Legal Services and Chief Commission Counsel at the Public Service Commission. The JSC also picked Paul Ndemo for the position of Deputy Chief Registrar of the Judiciary. He previously worked as Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecution. The vacancies were announced in January. The Constitution provides that the SRC should consist of a chairperson and a person each nominated by the Parliamentary Service Commission, Public Service Commission, Judicial Service Commission, National Police Service Commission, Teachers Service Commission, the Defence Council and the Senate on behalf of county governments. Others are one person each nominated by an umbrella agency representing trade unions, an umbrella body representing employers and a joint forum of professional bodies, the Treasury Cabinet Secretary, AG and Public Service CS. The SRC is one of the independent commissions established by the Constitution with the mandate of setting and regularly reviewing the remuneration and benefits of all state officers. It also advises the national and county governments on remuneration and benefits of all other public officers. Click here for the latest political news
