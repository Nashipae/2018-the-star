Homa Bay government plans to rotate the orthopedic Cuban doctor to conduct operations at major sub county hospitals in the county. Health executive Richard Muga said this is a way of taking healthcare services closer to the residents. He said the county has a single orthorpedic Cuban specialist whom they would not want to serve only at Homa Bay County Referral Hospital. Muga said all eight subcounty health facilities have theatres. “Subcounty health officials will regularly make operating lists for the doctor to attend to patients at their hospitals. The doctor would also respond to emergencies,” Muga said. The CEC said the doctor will handle bone fractures and maternal delivery complications. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, the CEC said in future, they will consider sharing the specialist doctors with neighbouring counties to improve healthcare services in Homa Bay. “Most counties received doctors with different specialisation hence it is prudent for counties to organise an exchange health service provision,” he said. On Monday, Homa Bay received two Cuban specialist doctors and they have begun working at Homa Bay County Referral Hospital.
