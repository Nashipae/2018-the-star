President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to within 30 days come up with a strategy on how to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the National Police Service. Uhuru also asked Matiang'i and IG Joseph Boinnet to equally address the persisting housing problem of officers and give the report within that period. "I have directed Matiang'i and Boinnet to provide me with a comprehensive policy framework and strategy," Uhuru said via Twitter on Tuesday. The government said it will allocate more resources to the National Police Service modernisation program to give the force the ability to neutralise all forms of threats to the safety and security of Kenyans. The modernisation of the force has included the provision of vehicles, modern weapons, armoured vehicles for special operations and revamping of the police air wing for air support services.
