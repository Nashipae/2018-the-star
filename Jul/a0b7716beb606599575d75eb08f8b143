Peace meetings in Baringo County have been postponed after the abduction of Silale MCA Nelson Lotela in Tiaty on Sunday. He was found in Sobea, Nakuru, early on Monday looking tired and confused. He told reporters from his hospital bed that he was unable to recognise the people who abducted him. Baringo county commissioner Henry Wafula told the Star in his office yesterday officials had prepared to hold a major peace meeting at Mukutani last Monday. But it was postponed. Mukutani is on the border of Tiaty and Baringo. The Pokot, Ilchamus and Tugen were to attend the meeting. “Lotela and other Pokot leaders from Tiaty have been in the forefront championing for peace. The meeting was postponed after the MCA’s abduction,” Wafula said. He said prior to the incident, they had held successful peace meetings in Chemoling’ot, Ameyan, Lokis Akwichatis, Paka, Amaya and Akoret until last week on Friday. Mukutani is the volatile zone where more than 800 Ilchamus families fled following an attack by bandits from a neighbouring community in March last year. They are now living at Eldume displaced persons’ camp in Baringo South. They have complained of worn out tents and appealed for help.
