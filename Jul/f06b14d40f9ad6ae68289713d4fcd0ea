Kenya’s Manvir Baryan and his British partner Drew Sturrock inched closer to their second career FIA African Rally Championship (ARC) title following victory in the Pearl of Africa Uganda Rally at the weekend. The Multiple Racing Team (MRT) led the Pearl round from start to finish in their Skoda Fabia R5. They racked up victory by four minutes and eights seconds. This was indeed the duo’s second and back-to-back career Pearl victory. The MRT crew is now on 75 points after five rounds. Uganda’s Jas Mangat wrapped up his campaign in second overall with 33 points on the leader board. “It was a nice day. We drove well and only had one slight issue. We broke a rim which got stuck on the caliber and took us time to change. But it was okay for us,” said Baryan. With a massive point’s difference, Baryan is now on the verge of a second ARC title with two races to go. “True, the championship is ours to lose at the moment. But we need to do Tanzania and see how it comes out. In case Piero wins and we drop out, then its game on in Rwanda. “So maybe after a win in Tanzania we can say its sealed,” said Sturrock, Baryan’s navigator. Baryan and Sturrock have featured in four ARC events this year. Pearl Rally is their third victory after South Africa and Zambia with a non finish in the home event Safari Rally. The MRT duo became the first ever non-South African crew to win the York Rally of South Africa this year.
