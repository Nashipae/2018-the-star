One pupil was injured and 15 parents arrested during protests on Thursday at Uasin Gishu Primary School in Eldoret. Parents who had been attending a standard prayer meeting ganged up with pupils to evict "strangers" living in staff quarters. Protesters who spoke to the Star claimed that some of those who were forced out were county workers. Parents complained that "strangers" have occupy school houses yet teachers travel to other locations for accommodation. Joseph Mwalo, who is the school board chairman, said the parents and pupils got angry after the school's new headteacher said she did not have a house. "The headteacher is forced to drive for an hour daily to the school yet strangers occupy the houses. That is not acceptable," he said.Â "We urge the Ministry of education to intervene as this has bothered us for many years." Mwalo said the houses had been occupied illegally for 15 years and that efforts to evict the people had been futile. He claimed that some of them had been turned into dens for the sale of drugs and alcohol to pupils. Eldoret OCS Julius Lingole and a contingent of police found the doors of all staff houses broken. Police uses tear gas to disperse the parents and pupils resulting in commotion and running battles at the school. Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno said the matter will be investigated.
