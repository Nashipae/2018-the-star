Nairobi residents are grappling with finding a good nursery school for their children. Many kindergartens have mushroomed in estates, lowering the quality of education in many centres. The county government is working to improve the quality and make it accessible for all. With more than 250,000 schoolchildren in Nairobi, the county has enrolled only 15,295 in the available 229 ECDE centres. Education executive Janet Ouko yesterday said, “We have 205 public ECDE centres in public primary schools and 24 standalone centres.” A Nairobi assembly committee on children, early childhood education and vocational training inspected five ECDEs in February. In the last financial year, the county set aside Sh1 billion to construct ECDE centres in the 85 wards. Only the foundation was done in 17 centres. In Ziwani Day nursery, the floor of the classrooms, toilet and headteacher’s office were dilaplated. In Starehe Day, the 40 pupils attend a school that was burnt down in 2016 in an alleged land grabbing dispute. The toilets lack drainage and the roof is falling. The committee also visited Ayany Primary, Kawangware and Tana Day Nursery. The sampled schools lacked title deeds and had no sign board. Ouko said the county will improve the state of the centres and employ 520 teachers. “The ECDEs will be free as the county has allocated a capitation of Sh3,815 to every child.”
