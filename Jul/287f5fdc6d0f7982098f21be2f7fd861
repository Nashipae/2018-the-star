The battle between Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati and the government over his gun has finally ended after the matter was settled out-of-court. Through his lawyer Arnold Oginga, Arati told the court the parties had entered into consent with all the respondents in the matter to withdraw the matter. Arati had sued the Firearm Licensing Board, Inspector General of Police and Ministry for Interior and Coordination. All the parties agreed to the withdrawal. “The Notice of Motion Application dated February 5, 2018 filed herein and is hereby marked as settled,” court documents read. Oginga told Justice John Mativo that Arati has already renewed his firearm licence and is in compliance with the rules. Arati sued the state for revoking his licence, withdrawing his firearm and bodyguards. He said the decision was not only arbitrary, but also against the rules of natural justice as no notification was issued and he was not given an opportunity to be heard. Arati said the move by the firearm board was an affront to the principle of the Constitution and his right to a fair hearing. He also said the decision to take away his security detail was against the principles of good governance set out in Article 10 of the Constitution and his rights to equal protection. In February, the security detail of many Nasa leaders was withdrawn and their firearms licences cancelled after the mock swearing-in of co-principal Raila Odinga as the people’s President.
