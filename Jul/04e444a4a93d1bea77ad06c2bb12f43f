More than 3,000 drivers plying their trade using online cab hailing apps have downed their tools today to demand fair pricing terms. The drivers normally use apps including Little, Uber, MaraMoja, BebaBeba,Taxify, MondoRide among a host of other online apps to scout for riders who pay for the taxi service. However the drivers and car owners are now crying foul over unfair pricing mechanisms that app companies employ to the detriment of the business. According to chairman Digital Taxi Association of Kenya David Muteru, the strike, which begins today, is to push for fair pricing for their services so that all players benefit. “We will seek audience with the transport Cabinet secretary, James Macharia to present our prayers for further action,” he said yesterday.  The industry players were advised by National Assembly to first seek government agencies in charge of transport, including the ministry and National Transport Safety Authority, who will acede to the prayers of the cab businesses, and in turn present them to the National Assembly in efforts to make laws to govern the sector. The drivers want the government to set up an independent committee to look into the business and who can be tasked with helping determine a pricing model for the business. “Last year when we sought the intervention of the Parliament, there was a delay in implementing some of the solutions that were recommended by the parliamentary committee on transport,” said Muteru on phone. Efforts to contact Uber for comment on the strike were not fruitful.
