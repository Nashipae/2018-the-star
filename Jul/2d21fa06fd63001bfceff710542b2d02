Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has hit out at Deputy President William Ruto for saying the national government has given the county Sh150 million for a CT scanner. Oparanya said it is untrue that the Kakamega County Teaching and Referral Hospital was allocated the money. He spoke at a burial in Mumias West subcounty on Saturday. Oparanya said the Jubilee leadership started “lying” to residents of Western in the run-up to last year’s general election. “They launched fake projects to hoodwink Luhyas to vote for them, but they failed. They came here and launched tarmacking of roads that never took off and you people continue clapping for them,” he said. A week ago, Ruto told a public rally at Musanda market in Mumias West that the government has allocated money for the machine. The DP has urged Luhyas to join Jubilee and stop begging for development after voting for the opposition. “You look for Uhuru and Ruto when it comes to development, but during elections you tell us ‘tibim’. If you continue plotting against us, we shall report you in heaven,” Ruto said. He said he is working closely with Oparanya, which the governor has denied. Oparanya was earlier reported to be warming up to the DP, strategising for the 2022 polls. He has urged the Luhya community to learn to protect its leaders like other communities. Oparanya said the community belittles its own leaders, denying them national recognition.
