Laikipia senator John Kinyua yesterday called for all corrupt governors to be arrested and charged. He said no one is above the law and the county bosses must not be spared. “No mater what position you hold in society, you should be arrested and charged if you are corrupt. Stop telling us you are a governor. Let’s not discriminate against anyone on this issue,” Kinyua said. He was reacting to the Council of Governors’ demand for its members be respected and accorded immunity while in office. The CoG wants governors protected from prosecution just like the President. This came after Busia governor Sospeter Ojaamong and county staff were arrested and charged with Sh20m fraud. The Director of Public Prosecutions approved the arrest. Governor Ojaamong was also accused of using a company called Madam R Ltd to defraud the county after it was awarded a waste management tender. CoG chairman Josphat Nanok on Monday said the fight against corruption was targetting some governors. He urged state agencies not to embarrass governors. "Though the fight against corruption is inevitable, it can’t be politicised and used selectively to target specific officers. Governors are heads of government and the war on corruption can’t be used to embarrass them,” Nanok said. But Kinyua said the CoG’s statement was uncalled-for and could derail the progress made in the war on corruption. “Even if I’m corrupt, arrest me. Why should I not be arrested?” he said. The graft war has intensified in recent weeks with a number of suspects being charged in court. Youth PS Lillian Omollo, former National Youth Service director general Richard Ndubai and others have been charged with the loss of cash at the agency. President Uhuru Kenyatta is leading the onslaught. He has ordered a lifestyle audit of all state officers. The President this week signed an agreement with the government of Switzerland to help Kenya recover stolen cash stashed in Swiss banks.
