A group of Gikomba traders has petitioned Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to investigate the fire. The fire, which happened last Thursday, is suspected to be arson.Seventeen people died and at least 60 others were injured. A section of Korogocho market was also burnt but no one was injured. Nairobi Business Community leader Wilfred Kamau yesterday said, “This is not the first time Gikomba market, which is home to thousands of Nairobians and which controls billions of shillings in businesses, has been torched. There are reports some people are claiming ownership of the Gikomba land.” “We are therefore convinced there is a person behind the destruction and we are asking, who are they?” Read: 15 dead, 60 injured in Gikomba market fire Kamau said county government officials have stopped traders from rebuilding their stalls. “On whose behalf are they stopping the rebuilding of the stalls?” he said. “Even if they want the traders to move out of the Gikomba land, we ask that they be moved with dignity.” Last Friday, Matiang’i said the National Police Service is investigating the cause of the fire and if the probe establishes a crime was committed, those responsible will face the music. Kamau said traders have continuously suffered losses. He said the destruction of businesses during relocation of traders by Kenha and county government officials during expansion of roads should stop. “We have seen demolitions in Kasarani, Kiambu Road, Kilimani and Roysambu. The county governments have a a lot of land to move these traders to better their livelihoods,” Kamau said. Read: What ails Gikomba market?
