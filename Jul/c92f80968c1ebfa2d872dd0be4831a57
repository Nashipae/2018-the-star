Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka yesterday said the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga made his work easy. He said on Saturday that before the Raila-Uhuru deal, Jubilee and NASA senators disagreed on virtually everything and one would think they were from different countries. It was difficult to conduct debates, Lusaka said. “Now there is peace,” he said during a fundraiser at Karatina Girls’ Secondary School in Mathira, Nyeri. Lusaka said Uhuru and DP William Ruto have a good working relationship and accused people he did not name of trying to divide Jubilee.
