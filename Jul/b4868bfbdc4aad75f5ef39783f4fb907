Vihiga Public Service Board does not know the number of staff it has employed. An audit report by the Directorate of Personnel Management shows the board failed to ensure the two-thirds gender rule during recruitments. It says men were largely left out. The audit began last September. At the time, the county had 3,234 employees. The 100-page document says ghost workers, underage and overage employees, doubtful casuals and similar names and ID numbers mar the county employee roll. The report was released on Wednesday. Governor Wilbur Otichillo said it will help him  to restructure his administration to come up with a lean and effective system. He faulted the board for lacking records of the county staff. “The CPSB did not provide any documentation that was requested by the DPM to aid the staff audit process,” Otichillo said. He said action will be taken against officers who will be found to have included 10 minors and 100 overage people on the payroll as permanent and pensionable employees. The report shows some people employed in job group G were promoted to job group R and Q within “a very short time”. “Such job groups like Q and R are not easily obtained. Even if you work in government for 40 years, you can’t easily be elevated to these groups. Surprisingly, here in Vihiga, such job groups were given to young people who were straight from the university,” Otichillo said. The report also reveals multiple salary arrears paid to some workers. It said more than 50 employees were earning ‘pending dues’ every month. Some of them are members of the CPSB. Contracts for some 491 employees aged 60 year and above were extended against employment regulations. Only persons living with disability and those with special skills should be engaged at ages 60 and above, the rules state. Otichillo said they will recover all illegal payments. MCAs will debate and vote on the report.
