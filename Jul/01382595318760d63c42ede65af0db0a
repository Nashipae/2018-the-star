Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula (pictured) has praised MPs for rejecting the report on the sugar crisis. The joint Agriculture and Trade parliamentary committee presented its findings on Thursday. Speaking in Kanduyi on Friday, the senator said the report was shoddily put together. “We in Bungoma, where many are sugarcane farmers, together with those in Kakamega, Busia, Siaya, Kisumu, Kericho, Homa Bay, Migori, Nandi and Narok, are disturbed,” he said. Wetang’ula criticised the massive importation of illegal sugar. The senator said bad sugar already in the market hurts growth chances of Chemelil, Muhoroni and Nzoia companies. He said the cost of sugar production in Kenya is too high. “Any sugar from outside Kenya that will sell cheaply hurts farmers’ efforts,” Wetang’ula said. The senator said the most worrying trend is that the people behind the illegal importation have licences. “I’m disturbed by the conduct of some of the representatives from sugar growing regions about their stand on this matter,” he said. Wetang’ula condemned politicians from sugar zones who appear to be defending the sugar barons. “A senator recently said he is ready to sacrifice his life for them [barons].”
