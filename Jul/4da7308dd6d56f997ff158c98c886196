Only half of Team Kenya athletes for next month’s Africa Championships in Nigeria have reported to the camp Head coach Stephen Mwaniki said the squad held their first training session yesterday morning at Karura Forest and then headed to Kasarani for mid-morning training session. Mwaniki observed that the Africa cross country champion Celliphine Chespol and Commonwealth Games 5,000m bronze medalist Edward Zakayo are currently with the kenya team in Tamper, Finland for the World Under-20 Championships in and are expected to link up with the team next week. Francis Cherono, who will also represent the country in the Africa Youth Championships in Algeria next week is also yet to report. Mwaniki said Erastus Kabugi and Caroline Kola will handle field events with Shirley Kalunda and Mwaniki handling the sprints, Julius Kirwa and Alex Sang will be in charge of the middle and long distance races. He expressed confidence that the team can surpass the target of eight gold medals won at the Africa Championship in Durban Kenya finished second at the championships with eight gold, eight silver and eight bronze medals, behind hosts South Africa. Mwaniki, who last handled the team during the Africa Championships on home soil in 2010, said the team will be going all out to win medals in sprints and field events’ Under Mwaniki’s watch, Kenya bagged 25 medals including 10 gold, seven silver and eight bronze medals during the 2010 continental show in 2010. Mwaniki said the three weeks will be adequate preparation for the continental extravaganza. “There are a few areas we are going to work on to ensure the athletes are in peak condition mentally and physically for the event,” he noted. Mwaniki said he has high hopes for the relay team in the 4x 400 meters. “We have very individual runners in the 400m and I believe we can do well in the relays. However, we anticipate tough competition from the likes of Botswana and South Africa but we are ready for the challenge,” he added.
