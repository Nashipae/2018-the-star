Fifteen Nigerian senators quit
the ruling All Progressives Congress party on Tuesday, making it
a minority in parliament's upper house, an aide to the Senate
president said, indicating worsening rifts in President
Muhammadu Buhari's political camp. Senate President Bukola Saraki said 15 senators had
"decamped", without giving details. The move comes weeks after a
faction of Buhari's ruling APC party said this month it no
longer supported his government. Deepening divisions threaten to split support for Buhari
within powerful patronage networks and among voters ahead of a
presidential poll scheduled for February 2019 that will decide
who runs Africa's top oil producer. "Total number of APC senators that defected is now 15. With
Senator Nyako signing few minutes ago. APC is now a minority in
the senate," said Saraki's aide, Bamikole Banks Omisore in a
tweet. Fourteen of the 15 who left the ruling party went to the
opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) which was in power
from 1999 until Buhari took office in 2015. It leaves Buhari
with a minority in the upper house for the first time since he
came to power. Relations between Buhari, the legislature and some members
of his own party have been strained for months with fissures
emerging in public over the last few weeks. Buhari, a 75-year-old former military ruler, said in April
that he would seek another term. His candidacy depends on party
approval, though that is usually considered to be a formality
for the incumbent. Parties must select their candidates for the
election between August 18 and October 7. Read: The race for Nigeria's presidency in 2019 Click here for the latest political news
