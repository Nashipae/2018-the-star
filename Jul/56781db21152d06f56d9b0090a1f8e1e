Kenya Under-20 volleyball women’s coach Paul Gitau is using the ongoing Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) Term Two Games to pick a provisional squad of 16 players fir next month’s Africa Nations Championship. Kenya will host the event from August 17- 26 at the Safaricom Indoor Arena, Kasarani. The championship is a qualifier for the FIVB World Championship later in the year. Gitau, who has pitched camp in Eldoret, said there is a lot of talent at his disposal but noted he will only settle for the best. Gitau, who guided the ‘B’ side of the national women’s team to win gold medal at the All Africa Games in Congo, Brazzaville in 2016, said he has also visited schools that failed to go past the regionals to see if they have good players. “We have good players here and I am impressed with what I am seeing. However, I will only settle on 16 players since we are pressed for time ahead of the championship,” said Gitau, who is attached to NAKS men’s volleyball team. He added: “Just so that I don’t lock out any good player, I have paid visit to some schools which failed to make the cut to the nationals to sample what they have.” The tactician expressed concern over the remaining period of training but exuded confidence that they will be ready. “The players I will have picked at the end of the week-long event might as well head to East Africa Games in Rwanda with their respective schools and that means I will have to wait. But the good thing is that they will be engaged in the competition and when they report to camp it will all be about fine tuning,” observed Gitau. Gitau will be deputised by former Mt. Kenya University women’s team coach Halima Bakari while the team’s trainer is Kenya Defence Forces women’s team coach and experienced national team setter Elisha Aliwa.
