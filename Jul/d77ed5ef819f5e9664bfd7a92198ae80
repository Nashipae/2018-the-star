AFC Leopards’ coach Rodolfo Zapata has unreservedly admitted that the 2018 SportPesa Premier League is out of reach following last Sunday’s 2-1 loss to bitter rivals Gor Mahia at Moi Stadium Kasarani.Zapata conceded that the league is for Gor Mahia to lose having gone 20 matches without tasting defeat and a massive 12 point gap between them and closest challengers Sofapaka. Since assuming to the rank of head coach in April, the Argentine who replaced Tanzanian Dennis Kitambi, has overseen ten league matches—winning four, drawing a similar number with two ending sourly. The tactician believes the remaining 11 matches are few to catch up with league runaway leaders Gor who have amassed 52 points from 20 matches and have three in hand. Ingwe, currently placed fifth with 36 points, trail Gor by 16 points and the stylish coach has intimated reverting to defending the Shield Cup after successfully rallying his charges to quarter finals after edging Mwatate United 2-1. Leopards are set to face National Super League side Kenya Police in the quarters Speaking after the hard fought win which came courtesy of goals from Eugene Mukangula and Ezekiel Odera to nullify John Musyoka’s early goal, Zapata assured of competitive next season as he had succeeded in building a strong and a relatively young squad. “Unfortunately we lost our last chance to fight for the league on Sunday but my short term goal remains to win the remaining matches and try to finish in the top three. I also want to defend the Shield Cup. In my long term goal, I am building a strong team for next season which will challenge for the league. I will give a detailed report on the progress at the end of the season.” He lauded his playing unit for rallying from a goal down to overpower the resilient Division One side who had surprisingly broken for the breather while leading. He singled out lack of concentration from the players he summoned for duty as the main undoing towards the poor first half display.
