Police are investigating eight people in connection with the theft of Sh5 million HIV testing kits from Murang’a County Referral Hospital. The suspects, including two Kenya Medical Training Centre students, have recorded statements at the Murang’a police station. The students were interns at the facility. They, two casual workers and four employees are believed to have had access to the store where the kits had been. On Saturday, chief health officer James Gitau said the county discovered the kits were missing after the Kirinyaga government sought assistance. Delivery of supplies to Kirinyaga had been delayed and it urgently needed similar kits, he said. Gitau said only one carton of the kits was found, yet there were no documents to explain the disappearance of the others. DCIO Japheth Maingi said they will be charged in court once investigations are concluded. Gitau said the theft could have been plotted by a cartel that has been blamed for a massive loss of drugs in the hospital. Patients had complained that they were referred to private pharmacies, though the drugs they needed were available. Gitau said the medics receive commissions from private pharmacies for referring patients to them. He said the cartel also frustrated plans by the county to offer free medication to patients suffering from chronic illnesses. “They would send people to get pricey drugs from the pharmacies for free, then sell them to private pharmacies or in their private clinics,” Gitau said. Patients with chronic illnesses have been instructed to go for the drugs direct from the hospital. A month ago, a clinical officer was interdicted after he confessed to deliberately prescribing asthma drugs to a patient who had a nasal infection and referring him to a specific pharmacy. Gitau issued a memo to all medics, instructing them to include their full names on forms when prescribing medicines for patients referred to private pharmacies. This followed a public uproar.
