Striking employees of the Noltresh Water and Sanitation Company want the firm’s management reverted to the national government for a clear command. The workers say the company is answerable to three counties because it operates in Machakos, Kajiado and Makueni. That has made it difficult to resolve management issues. “The problems being witnessed are actually a result of not having a clear command. It will always be difficult to find a solution as long as the counties are pulling in different directions,” workers union chair Braison Odhiambo said. There is water shortage in Makueni and Machakos due to the strike. On Monday, residents of Emali town blocked the Nairobi-Mombasa Highway to protest against lack of water. On Wednesday, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and Kajiado Water executive Florence Waigajo held a meeting with the employees and asked them to return to work. The meeting at a church in Sultan Hamud had heated exchanges between the workers and Kajiado water chief officer Douglas Konana, who threatened to sack those who did not return to work. The workers demanded that he stay away from the meeting. The workers also refused an offer by Kibwana that three counties contribute Sh2.5 million each to pay part of salary arrears. The more than 150 workers demand arrears amounting to Sh70 million. “We’ve not been paid for 11 months. We’re demanding full payment,” steward George Kaleve said.
