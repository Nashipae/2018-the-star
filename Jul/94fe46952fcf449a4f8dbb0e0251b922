Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja yesterday told Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen to stop disrespecting President Uhuru Kenyatta by rubbishing the Head of State’s directives. The President must be respected as the Jubilee Party leader. Any issues arising from his quest to fight corruption and foster peace should be handled internally, Sakaja said in a statement. “Inciting Kenyans against Uhuru’s initiatives — Building Bridges and the fight against corruption — as well as undermining his leadership will no longer be acceptable,” Sakaja said. He was responding to remarks by Murkomen on Thursday while in Narok that opposition leader Raila Odinga was behind the Mau evictions in the spirit of the handshake. “Some people who recently joined the government through the backdoor are working with some government officials to remove people from Mau,” Murkomen said. “In their memorandum which led to a peace deal, one of the agenda items was to evict people from Mau so that they create a wedge between the settlers and their leaders,” he added. The Elgeyo Marakwet senator said the evictions were geared towards scuttling Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 bid by turning the affected communities against him. He was with nine Jubilee MPs. Yesterday, Sakaja termed Murkomen’s remarks as “disingenuous, underhand and disrespectful” to the President. The Star has established there are growing concerns in ODM that Ruto is taking advantage of the truce between the ex-Prime Minister and President Kenyatta to raid Raila’s lieutenants and reposition himself.
