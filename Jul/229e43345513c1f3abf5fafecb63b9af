Kagwe Mungai has kept his love life private and has never showed off his girlfriend in the past. During an interview with Adelle and Shaffie on Kiss 100, he said he has dated before but ended up being heartbroken. "I am not dating anyone now because I don't want disruptions. Plus I have been busy with my album," he said. "I dated some days way back, which did not work. My heart has been cheated on for so many times. The girl actually told me who she played me with, but after we broke up, because we were still best of friends." That experience inspired him to do the song, Creeper.Â Kagwe has a new song called Super Sinner, inspired his childhood songs.
