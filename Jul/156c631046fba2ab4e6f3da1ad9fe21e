The High Court in Narok has declined to grant Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony orders stopping the ongoing Mau evictions. Instead, Justice Mohammed Kullow of the Land and Environment court certified the case as urgent. Judge Kullow further directed the Governor to file and serve the respondents and all parties ahead of an inter-parties hearing on August 6. Through lawyer Peter Wanyama, Chepkwony asked the court to temporarily stop the "inhumane" evictions of people who have title deeds. He cites claims that security officers are burning houses and beating up property owners in a display of impunity. The county boss acknowledges that the government has the right to evict persons inside the gazetted Mau Forest but notes that parts of land in former group ranches are not in the forest. According to the Governor, the government created a cut line in 2008Â to separate group ranches and the forest. He says Nyayo Tea Zones Development Corporation was then allocated the land that borders the forest. The county boss further notes that the land is several kilometres from the forest. Among those sued are Environment CS Keriako Tobiko, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and Narok county commissioner George Natembea.
