The Court of Appeal in Nairobi yesterday ruled that Mohamed Ahmed Kolosh was validly elected to represent Wajir West Constituency in Parliament. The Court, while validating Kolosh’s victory said elections were conducted in line with the law, and the nullification of his win by the High Court in March was without a basis. The appeal had been filed by the petitioner -Abdirahman Ibrahim Mohamed (Kanu) who successful challenged Kolosh’s win at the High Court. Kolosh had also filed a cross –appeal. Abdirahman wanted the Court of Appeal to find that the High Court erred by failing to declare him the polls winner having ruled that results in two polling stations were inflated in Kolosh favor. But Justices William Ouko, Patrick Kiage and Agnes Murgo said such a decision could only have been made if all the votes that were casted in the constituency were recounted.

The cross appeal succeed in its entirety and we hereby set a set the decision rendered by the High court,” the judges ruled. Justice Francis Tuiyot of the High Court had ordered the Electoral Agency to conduct fresh elections citing a deliberate plan to suppress the will of the voters. The judge said the petitioner -Abdirahman Ibrahim Mohamed (Kanu) had proved that there the results in two polling stations- Qara and Korich were manipulated in favour of Kolosh. The Judge found that it the two polling stations, voters who cast their votes exceeded the number of registered voters. Justice Toiyot had also found that in Qara polling station, the number of votes cast exceeded those of the registered voters by 162 votes. His view was that the outcome was soiled because it is difficult to distinguish the “good votes from the bad ones”. However, the Court of Appeal faulted the judge for considering issues that were not pleaded in the petition. Click here for the latest political news
