A pride of eight lions that escaped from Mt Kenya National Park on Thursday has been terrorizing residents around Muriru in Naromoru. They are also roaming around Wakariru area. On Friday, the pride ate a horse and two cows near Mount Kenya holiday homes. Most kids are unable to go to school for fear of being attacked. Kenya Wildlife Service officials said they have only managed to capture one. Residents have threatened to poison or kill them if no action is taken within the next four days. In June 2016, a lion sneaked from the Nairobi National Park but later returned unharmed. The cat that had been seen in Karen returned to the park after two days. “It came back to the park near Multimedia University College and a report was made at 10 o’clock,” said Paul Gathitu, KWS head of corporate communications. The same year in April, Kenya Wildlife Service dispatched a team to track at least five lions and hyenas that were terrorising residents of Magarini in Kilifi county. The lions were suspected to have escaped from Tsavo National Park and Boni Forest. They had invaded villages in the area and killed several domestic animals.
