The Employment and Labour Relations Court has summoned IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and two of his commissioners over CEO Ezra Chiloba's suspension. They are to explain why they should not be jailed six months for disobeying a court order that allowed Chiloba to resume work. They are required to personally appear in court within the next 30 days. Chebukati suspended Chiloba for the second time on June 14, hours after the latter was reinstated by the court. He said at the time that the move was based Clauses 3 and 5 of Chiloba's employment contract which states that the CEO is responsible for the prudent management of the commission's finances. Details: IEBC crisis persists as Chebukati suspends Chiloba yet again Chebukati says in an affidavit that the decision to send Chiloba away was well informed considering the position he holds in the commission. An audit report revealed that about Sh1 billion may have been lost through flawed procurement of materials for last year’s twin general elections. In the affidavit, the chair said anomalies unraveled include goods being delivered after the polls, inflated tenders and undelivered goods. Chebukati said the revelations backed the commission’s decision to suspend the chief executive.
