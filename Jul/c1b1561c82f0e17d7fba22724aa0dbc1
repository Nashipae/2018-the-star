Homa Bay county secretary Isaiah Ogwe yesterday dismissed claims he is eyeing the governor’s seat in 2022. He said he is a civil servant and does not want to be drawn into politics. “I’ve not announced anywhere that I plan to run for the office. It is doing the rounds maybe because the people want me to vie. As per now, I’m still serving the people,” Ogwe told the Star. With less than a year after the last election, politics about the 2022 poll has gained momentum. Woman MP Gladys Wanga and ODM national chairman John Mbadi are among potential governor candidates. The Appeal Court has yet to determine a case filed by Governor Cyprian Awiti who wants a ruling by the High Court annulling his election overturned. Former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga, Homa Bay Town MP Opondo Kaluma and Trade executive Carlius Ademba have accused Awiti of mismanaging the county. The county boss has, however, dared anyone to table evidence.
