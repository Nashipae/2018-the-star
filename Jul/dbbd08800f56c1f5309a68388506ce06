ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna has apologised to Luhya leaders he has been accused of insulting in public. "I want to say if there is anyone who is aggrieved by my utterances and feels disrespected, then forgive me," he said in Vihiga. "But if you find your father with a torn cloth, and you take a needle to sew it, and the needle accidentally slides and pierces him that was not the intention. The intention was to save him from people laughing at him." Sifuna and some ODM politicians have been accused of attacking top Luhya leaders, particularly ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang’ula, referring to them as “cowards and naive”. The attacks came after they skipped the mock swearing-in of opposition leader Raila Odinga as the People’s President. They have also rubbished plans by Mudavadi and Wetang’ula to collapse their parties into one strong outfit to bring together the Luhya community vote bloc in 2022. They have termed the move as tribal. "It is only that when I try to advice against certain issues, people say am being disrespectful," he said. Sifuna said Luhyas stand a better chance of inheriting Raila’s political support if they stood with him in his quest for the presidency. "I am the secretary general. I sign certificates and [Wycliffe] Oparanya is the deputy party leader. If we remain with Raila, we shall plead with him to support a Luhya," he said. Oparanya has announced his interest in the 2022 race.
