Strong winds of more than 40 knots are expected to hit parts of Coastal region from today up to Saturday. The meteorological department says other parts to be affected by the winds include Northwestern, Northeastern and Eastern. In an advisory, the forecaster warned of damages in the counties of Lamu, Kilifi, Mombasa, Kwale and Tana-River, Kitui, Garissa, Isiolo, Wajir, Marsabit, Samburu, Turkana and Mandera. “Residents in these regions are advised to be on the lookout and on high alert for potential damages associated with strong winds such as: structural damages, like blowing off of roofs, uprooting of trees, dust storms which may cause respiratory problems, large waves over the Indian Ocean and reduced visibility,” the advisory read in part. The weatherman indicated the severity of the winds as ‘strong to very strong’ terming the condition as an extreme weather event. The speed of the wing is expected to increase to 50 knots (25.7 m/s) over Northeastern and Coastal regions on Wednesday 18th July 2018 to Thursday 19th July 2018 at 6 am. A university don Maarifa Mwakumanya, who has expertise in environmental health sciences has warned that the winds could culminate in strong waves and cause beach erosion. “Boats that go beyond the reefs will easily capsize,” he said adding that the fisheries livelihood will be at stake. Last week, strong waves drowned four fishermen in the Indian Ocean at Nyali Beach. Polices and rescuers are yet to retrieve the bodies.
