Women at the Coast want the government to make HIV testing mandatory for men who want to be polygamous under customary law. The women say the Marriage Act of 2014 favours men and does not support women’s rights in marriage. Women MPs in 2014 walked out in protest when the Bill was passed after deleting the provision that men must inform their wives before taking another wife. On Wednesday, Coast Women Power founder Emma Mbura said men who marry many wives without informing the first wife expose them to the risk of contracting STDs. “A law should be passed that before a husband marries any wife, he should go for a mandatory HIV test,” Mbura said on the phone.
