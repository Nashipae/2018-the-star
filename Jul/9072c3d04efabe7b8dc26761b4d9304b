More than 300 people living with disabilities have received specialised wheelchairs from the Murang’a county government. The imported wheelchairs have been modified to suit the needs of beneficiaries who first underwent a medical assessment. Murang’a Health CEC Joseph Mbai said the wheelchairs were part of a programme the county government has been running since 2014. The beneficiaries are among 617 disabled persons who have already undergone medical checkup. Speaking at Ihura Stadium on Wednesday, Mbai said the rest will receive their wheelchairs soon. He asked families with people suffering from disabilities to present to them at Murang’a County Referral Hospital for assessment. He said the assessment helps the county government to establish the kind of disability affecting the beneficiaries and makes it easy to recommend the right wheel chair for them.
