Leaders want dialogue between elders from the Borana in Isiolo county and Auliyan of Lagdera in Garissa to resolve a bloody border dispute. Three people have been killed in the conflict and 250 others displaced. Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo said on Saturday that the Isiolo-Garissa border row is getting out of hand. “Schools around El dera and Tana areas have already been closed. The two communities lived together for decades and intermarried. Why is the border issue popping up now?” she asked. Dullo said more than 250 people have moved from El dera to Garbatula and are living in camps. “Security agencies should move with speed and restore normalcy for schools to reopen as pupils need to prepare for the national exams,” she said. Garissa Town MP Aden Duale also said conflict will not be tolerated anymore. He said elders from both counties, religious and political leaders, led by the two governors, should resolve the stalemate to stop bloodshed. The leaders spoke at Modogashe during a funds drive attended by Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday. The DP said the conflict will stall development.
