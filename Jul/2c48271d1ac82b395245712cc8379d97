 This year’s Mombasa
International Show has attracted 450 exhibitors, the Agricultural Society
of Kenya said on Friday. ASK Mombasa branch chairperson Anisa Abdhalla said the exhibitors are almost four times the number of those in last year's event. The show is scheduled to run from August 29 to September 2. “Last year, we had 119 local and international exhibitors. We have already received 450 exhibitors and 190 reservations for this year's show,” Abdhalla said. She spoke during a tour of the ASK showground in Mkomani in Nyali constituency. The official said they are expecting about 100,000 show-goers this
year. “We have special programmes
and events that we expect will attract more people to the show. We are
not only targeting schools, but also the general public,” she said. Abdhalla said the show will be more colourful than the last edition. Last year, ASK attracted fewer participants. The management attributed the situation to the August * General Election and the repeat presidential poll on October 26. President Uhuru Kenyatta was expected to be the guest of honour during the official open the show. He however did not attend. Instead, then Public Service Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki [now Health CS) represented the Uhuru. The President is
expected to open the show this year as has been the tradition. The Mombasa Agricultural Show was established in 1903. In 2002, President Daniel Moi elevated it to an international show to attract investors and players in the agriculture, trade
and tourism sectors.
