Another school in Siaya, Maliera Boys Secondary has been closed after students threatened to strike. This is the third school in the region to be closed in a span of just one week. The students had been threatening to go on strike from Tuesday demanding a school bus and entertainment session over the weekend. Principal Samuel Oyondi said he decided to close the institution to avert the destruction of property. “We were of the opinion to single out the ringleaders but we thought that would have led to a massive distraction and that is why we sent all of them home,” said Oyondi. Other schools that have gone on strike are Ng’iya Girls secondary school in Alego/Usonga sub-County and Maranda Boys High school in Bondo sub -County. The principal said the students will report back on Tuesday next week. He said they are going to meet with the board and other stakeholders to seek an amicable solution to avert a possible strike in the future. “We have talked to our students on several occlusions on matters of discipline but it’s like our advice has always fallen on deaf ears, we also are asking parents to intervene to instil good moral in the children while at home,” he added.
