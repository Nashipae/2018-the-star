On Thursday MPs in the National Assembly were not happy with the preliminary report on sugar imports by the Agriculture and Trade committee. The committee had been working for 10 days but did not identify any poisonous sugar or tax avoiders. Their colleagues were angry. The committee members felt aggrieved with some justification. The sugar situation is very confused - the contamination was wildly exaggerated and government did have a tax free window open for several months last year. Nevertheless they could have done a better job. The committee summoned officials and suppliers, and visited warehouses across the country. There is a widespread suspicion that MPs sometimes do deals. On Thursday Speaker Justin Muturi even criticised the committee members for "hugging and kissing" those they were interviewing. More critically there is now a widespread practice of members of parliamentary committees signing into simultaneous parallel sessions to maximise their sitting allowances. This is very wrong and inevitably will result in shoddy output from the committees. The Speaker should stop MPs from signing into more than one committee session each day.
