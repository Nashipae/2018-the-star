A company has filed a suit to unfreeze its bank accounts linked to the National Youth Service scandal. One Two One fashion says it has never been charged and has no relationship with the service. It says the order obtained by the state to freeze its accounts is unfair. “The freezing of the applicant’s bank account was done without proper investigation into the applicant’s alleged role. The freezing is unreasonable, malicious and unconstitutional,” reads the suit papers. The company is among 113 whose accounts were frozen after the Asset Recovery Agency got court orders to investigate alleged money laundering. In its application, the company says it has been subjected to business hardship and suffered loss as a result of the freeze order. The company says it has an overdraft of Sh5 million and a loan, but it is unable to access the facilities to trade. According to court papers, the company learnt of the freeze order on June 8. It was denied access to its account at Standard Chartered Bank. Also in court fighting the order is Advance Quick Fit Ltd. In June, an ARA agent obtained orders freezing 113 accounts in 13 banks for six months to enable it to investigate money laundering claims. The order was given to police officer Fredrick Musyoki to scrutinise account opening documents, statements of account since their inception to date, cheques, cash deposits and RTGS transfers. “Whereas it has been proved to me on oath that for purposes of an investigation into commission of offence of money laundering and tracing of proceeds of crime, an order of production be and is hereby issued to inspect the books....,” the order by a magistrate reads. Musyoki said he needed the court’s permission to look into the accounts to ascertain the allegations. Court documents show the agency got information on April 26 that funds had been stolen from the NYS through collusion of staff and suppliers. The application by the two companies will be heard tomorrow.
