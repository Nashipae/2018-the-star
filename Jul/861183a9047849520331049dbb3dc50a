Kenyan champions Gor Mahia will be going for a double against Zanzibari side Jeshi la Kujenga Uchumi(JKU) in the Cecafa Kagame Cup third-place play-off match at National Stadium, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania today. Gor beat JKU 2-0 during the SportPesa Super Cup quarter-finals last month in Nakuru and they will be out to extend that feat. The local champions fell to defending champions Azam 2-0 in the semis on Wednesday while JKU went down 1-0 to a Meddie Kagere-led Simba. K’Ogalo were seeking to end their 33-year drought of the regional inter-club tournament. Gor coach Dylan Kerr is likely to field his second string squad to allow his regular starters a rest ahead of the Caf Confederations Cup group stage match against Tanzanian giants Yanga on Wednesday in Nairobi. Yanga, who sit bottom of Group ‘D’ with just a point gave the Kagame Cup a wide berth as they seek to save their diminishing continental dream, giving Rwandese side APR a shot at regional glory. Meanwhile, the SportPesa Premier League clash pitting Gor and Posta Rangers set for this Sunday has been shelved. “The Posta Rangers vs Gor Mahia match that was set to be played on Sunday at the Narok Stadium has been postponed. A new date will be announced in due course,” read a statement on the body’s online portal.
