Lokolo hitmaker Papa Dennis has praised local producers Mainswitch and Teddy B. The gospel star, who's signed under Maliza Umaskini foundation, has described Teddy B as a down-to-earth and soft-spoken man. "He is humble and his work is A-class. I like the way he carries himself around, very mature," he told Word Is. Dennis said after recording his songs, they are sent to US multi-platinum mix engineer Benny Steele for mastering. He said Mercy Masika, Gloria Muliro, Esther Wahome are his favourite artistes, and if given a chance to work with them, he cannot turn it down. Dennis praised his boss for being supportive. "Sadat Muhindi is a good boss and loves music. That's why he's nurturing talents out there," he said.
