The Samburu government will buy 20,000 circumcision knives in efforts to prevent the spread of HIV infections among those facing the cut. The Social Services, Gender and Culture department has launched a programme called One Knife One Boy. It will also purchase gloves and other health equipment for the rite of passage to be held in August. Chief officer Andrew Lenyasunya yesterday said Samburu boys are circumcised en masse and measures must be put in place to avert health risks. “Boys are usually circumcised in big numbers using one knife. To avoid the spread of HIV infection, we’ve trained circumcisers in hygiene and will provide gloves and sterilisers,” he said. Governor Moses Lenolkulal said his government will ensure no boy drops out of school after they are initiated into manhood. “Those who have not enrolled in school will also be encouraged to join the shepherd education programme,” he said.
