The Education ministry will not abolish boarding schools in an effort to prevent arson, Education PS Belio Kipsang has said. He said the ministry plan to start day sections in boarding schools to increase the number of students accessing secondary education. Kipsang said the system worked in public universities when parallel courses were introduced, which has enabled the enrolment of more than 500,000 university students. “We want to provide an opportunity for every child to learn in day and boarding. We are not discontinuing boarding schools,” he said. The PS spoke in Malindi during a prize-giving day on Saturday. He said some of the best performing schools such as Strathmore and Kianga are day schools. A proposal to abolish boarding schools has received mixed reactions. Some view it as one way of preventing unrest and dormitory arson by discontented students. Kipsang warned students against burning schools, saying they will face the full force of the law. He said any student found guilty of burning school will be treated as a criminal. The PS urged petrol stations attendants not to sell fuel to people carrying containers, as they contribute to the increased cases of school fires. Kipsang also told candidates to forget about exam leakages. “Integrity of the exams is up to standards. Nobody, even the cartels, shall see the examination materials,” he said.
