While making the announcement, Professional Golfers of Kenya (PGK) captain CJ Wangai, said the 32 were selected through a local qualifying system. “It’s such a good opportunity for the Kenyan pros as we now have a chance of being ranked in the Sunshine Tour and securing possible invites for the players who will play well, thanks to KCB for the unswerving golfing support,” said Wangai. “Standards have been set and only the sky is the limit for Team Kenya,” added Wangai. Also in the mix are former top amateur Alfred Nandwa of Railway, Anil Shah (Royal Nairobi), Boniface Kosgey (Golf Park) and CJ Wangai, who is the resident pro at Sigona.
