The Court of Appeal in Kisumu has upheld the election of Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama. Judge Stephen Gatembu dismissed the appeal and ordered petitioner Walter Nyambati to pay Sh3 million as costs for the suit. Gatembu said the appeal lacked merit and was filed at the wrong registry. He also said the petitioner introduced new evidence which was not present in the petition. This was Nyambati's second attempt to reverse Nyangarama's win after the High Court in Kisii quashed his initial petition on February 27. Judge James Makau said Nyambati failed to prove his allegations. The judge said the irregularities found during the scrutiny of votes were insufficient to invalidate Nyagarama's victory. In his appeal, Nyambati argued that Judge Makau failed to consider the evidence adduced before him. He hired three more lawyers to represent him in the appeal. The former Jubilee candidate lost the Nyamira governorship race after garnering 58,936 votes against Nyangarama's 65,161 votes.
