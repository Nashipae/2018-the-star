Barclays Africa Group Limited has officially changed its name to Absa Group but will operate and trade as Barclays in Kenya for now. The change came after the London-based Barclays PLC divested from Barclays Africa as part of a separation arrangement. The official change was announced via Twitter on Wednesday. On October 1, 2017, the organisation relocated seven of its branches in Kenya - Moi Avenue, Haile Salassie, Waiyaki Way, Kawangware, Rahimtulla, Nakumatt Meru branch and Wundanyi - to save costs. Barclays announced on March 1, 2016 that it intended, over a two to three-year period, to reduce its shareholding in Barclays Africa. On May 5, 2016, Barclays PLC sold 103.6 million shares in Barclays Africa, reducing its shareholding to 50.1 percent. In June 2017, Barclays PLC sold 187 million ordinary shares in Barclays Africa Group, which represents approximately 22 percent of Barclays Africa’s issued share capital reducing its shareholding in Barclays Africa to below 50 percent. Barclays Africa operates in 12 countries with approximately 40 thousand employees who serve close to 12 million customers.
