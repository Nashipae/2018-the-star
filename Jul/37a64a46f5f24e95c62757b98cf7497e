Police in Makueni are hunting for a man caught on camera assaulting his wife in Kya-aka village in Muvau. The video circulating on the internet shows the 33-year-old being kicked and pushed to the ground. Chief Andrew Kisenge said the man followed the woman who had gone to graze animals in the field and attacked her. He accused his wife of infidelity. The video is believed to have been shot by people who responded to the woman's distress call. In the clip, a man demands that the suspect stops beating his wife while a woman pleads with the attacker to spare her. However, the suspect shouts back and threatens to slit his wife's throat. Makueni county police commander Joseph Napeiyan said the incident happened on Monday. "We are appealing to the public to share the suspect's contacts so that we can trace him," he told the Star in an interview. Napeiyan said the victim will record a statement after treatment.
