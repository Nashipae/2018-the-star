This is clear from the prosecution evidence,” Lesiit said. And during her mitigation she regretted the incident, saying since then, she has been engaged in various activities at Langat Women Prison remand. She told the court that prior to her arrest she had been admitted at Kenyatta University where she was to pursue her degree which has been cut off following the case against her. She said that at the prison she has also engaged in other courses and that she has been disciplined to mix with other members of society. The court heard that she comes from a family of a single mother who had educationally invested in her after her only brother died. However, in response to her mitigation, the prosecution told the court that she did not show remorse during the trial. The prosecution asked the court to reject her plea for lenient and sentence her for death as provided in law.
