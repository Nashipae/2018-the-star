Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga (pictured) has denied claims she wants to run for governor should the county go for a by-election. Wanga yesterday said  rumours that she is planning to resign and run for governor ahead of 2022 are aimed at distracting voters. She described those spreading rumours as spoilers. “I have neither thought nor considered resigning. Spoilers are out to ruin others politically,” Wanga said. Governor Cyprian Awiti and deputy governor Hamilton Orata went to the Supreme Court to challenge the nullification of their reelection into the office. Two courts had annulled the election before the two leaders went the Supreme Court. Former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga challenged the election of Awiti. Wanga said she is focused on serving residents until the next general election. “Homa Bay people handed me the woman representative mandate. Abandoning that work prematurely would be doing them a disservice,” Wanga said.
