Muhoroni Sugar Company, which halted operations two months ago, has received two joint receiver managers as the government plans to reopen the firm. The company is expected to resume operations next Monday. Muhoroni was shut for six weeks on May 21 over what the management attributed to a shortage of cane to crush. The managers Elisha Ooko and Harun Kirui have replaced Asa Okoth and Fredrick Kebeney whom farmers and Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o accused of incompetence and mismanagement. Kenya National Federation of Sugarcane Farmers Muhoroni branch chairman Charles Anyumba last month asked government to expeditiously resolve the problems bedeviling firm. He told the government to place the factory under new management. Kirui and Ooko held meetings with farmers and employees last Friday after taking over the management. Ooko told the Star they had requested for Sh600 million from the government to run the factory. “We anticipate resuming operations next week if get Sh48 million,” he said. “We are also negotiating with KRA over the debts we owed them to enable us acquire new machines and gets back to normal production before we can pay them.” KNFSF secretary general Noah Opiyo said they tabled their demands to the managers before they resume work. The demands are payment of Sh300 million to farmers and Sh70 million for transporters. Read : MPs call for Muhoroni bailout as KRA claims over Sh860 million Click here for the latest political news
