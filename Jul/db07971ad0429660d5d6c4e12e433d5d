I am super excited and also still surprised, Kenyan writer Makena Onjerika has said hours after winning the Sh1.3m Caine awards. Onjerika won the 2018 Caine Prize for African Writing for her short story 'Fanta Blackcurrant', beating four other finalists. "I did not expect it. I had a person that i was betting for among the shortlisted writers... and then i heard my name and i was like are you sure it was me you mentioned?" She told BBC on Tuesday. Onjerika said they had to keep talking for a few minutes to let it sink in before she could believe that indeed she was the one who had been called. Described as Africa’s leading literary award, the short story was published by Wasafiri in (2017).
