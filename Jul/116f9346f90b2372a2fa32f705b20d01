Police in Murang'a are holding a man suspected to have been cohabiting with a 14-year-old girl. Mbugua Chege, 22, was arrested on Monday night after he was found living with the standard seven pupil. The minor went missing from her home in Njumbi, Mathioya sub-county last year. Mathioya Deputy County Commissioner said after being interrogated, the girl revealed that she ran away from her home due to their "high handedness". “The suspect was employed by an avocado broker and met the girl in his line of duty,” the commissioner said. He said the girl has been reunited with her family and will be taken for counselling. “We also want the girl to resume her education as soon as possible to ensure she lives her life normally,” he said. The suspect will be charged with defilement in Kangema law courts. “Whether or not the girl lived with him voluntarily, it is illegal to cohabit with an underage who has not attained the age of consent,” he said.
