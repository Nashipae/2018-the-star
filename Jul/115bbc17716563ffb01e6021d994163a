Two woman MPs have defended their Laikipia counterpart Catherine Waruguru who was kicked out of a Kericho hotel with her husband for not having a marriage certificate. They are Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni wa Muchomba and Kandara MP Alice Wahome. Waruguru said she is in a polygamous marriage. “I am hearing all sorts of rumours that I was with a ‘toy boy’. I was only with one man by the name William Kiprotich Kiget who is my husband. He is in a polygamous set up and I am not embarrassed about it,” she said. Waruguru said she checked into the hotel at 4pm on Saturday, filled the registration card and was given a room before leaving for dinner with her in-laws. ‘sleep with whoever you want’ Upon returning at 9pm, Waruguru said she was not allowed into her room for lack of a marriage certificate. She described the incident as barbaric and backward. “I have been single and I know the kind of discrimination single women go through,” Waruguru said. In 2014, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed into law the Marriage Act which allows polygamy. “Marriage is the voluntary union of a man and a woman whether in a monogamous or polygamous union,” Uhuru said in a statement. Muchomba said, “When these two people decided to walk into a hotel and do their job, what business do you have with that activity? It is not the basic function of a hotelier to ask you who you are going to sleep with and how you are going to sleep with that person”. Wahome said she would start a legal suit against the hotel management.
