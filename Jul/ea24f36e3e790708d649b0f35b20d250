Two people died on the spot and several others were injured in a dawn accident yesterday at the Subuiga black spot in Buuri, Meru county.
The driver of the Moyale Raha bus, which was heading to Moyale from Nairobi, lost control of the vehicle, which crashed.
Buuri police boss Joseph Obara said the bus carried 60 passengers.
Fifteen were taken to Kirua Mission Hospital, treated and discharged. Those seriously injured were taken to Isiolo Hospital, Obara said. He said police could not immediately establish the number of those taken to Isiolo because the rescue operation was going on.
Obara cautioned drivers using the Nanyuki-Moyale road to drive carefully and follow traffic rules.
Two months ago, a woman died after a head-on collision accident involving a Menany matatu and a private car. Several others were injured.
On February 10, four people perished after a truck ferrying fertiliser veered off the road and rammed houses near the Subuiga junction. Three people were injured.
 The truck was heading to Isiolo from Mombasa when the driver lost control at the black spot. The then Buuri police boss, David Muange, said the driver may have been exhausted or truckâ€™s brakes failed.
