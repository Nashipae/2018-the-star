Conditional cash transfer programmes have improved enrolment and retention of adolescent girls in primary schools in Wajir by 20 per cent, a study shows. A baseline survey conducted by Adolescent Girls Initiative - Kenya between February 2015 and September last year, shows enrolment increased to 95 per cent from 75 per cent. “At baseline, 21 per cent of girls had never been to school and 78 per cent were lagging behind in school relative to their age. There is marked improvement in girls’ attendance of school,” reads part of the report. There are significant changes in numeracy skills of girls. The report shows 50 per cent of girls who were in school when programme started could read two English sentences correctly compared to two per cent before the project. At midline, the figure increased to 79 per cent of girls in school at both baseline and midline, as compared to 37 per cent of girls who were out of school at baseline and midline. In areas where enrolment was close to 100 per cent such as Kibera, cash transfers improved completion of primary school from 84 per cent to 91 per cent. Transition to secondary school also rose from 81 to 89 per cent. The Adolescent Girls Initiative - Kenya delivered multi-sectoral interventions to more 6,000 girls aged 11 and 15 in Kibera and Wajir. The intervention had four components that are community-based violence prevention programme, an education conditional cash transfer, health focused girls empowerment clubs and wealth creation via financial education and savings. The endline data will be collected next year to assess the impact of the programme. The education intervention involved a cash transfer pegged on 80 per cent attendance during each school term. There was a cash transfer of Sh1,125 fees paid twice per term in Kibera and Sh1,500 in Wajir, schooling kits and an incentive of Sh500 for each girl enroled in the cash transfer program. The cash was paid directly to schools. Click here for the latest political news
