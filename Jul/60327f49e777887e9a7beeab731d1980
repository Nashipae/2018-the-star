Tension was high at Irewa village in Kahuro sub-county, Murang’a as two kidnap suspects killed by police last week were laid to rest on Friday. Majority of the residents had kept off the ceremony and only attended when police arrived. Peninah Wambui Muturi,80, and her 28-year-old nephew Samuel Kimani were buried in hasty and only a few speakers addressed the mourners. A third suspect John Mwangi will be buried on Saturday at Njumbi village in Mathioya sub-county. The three were shot dead on July 20 after kidnapping 36 years old Margaret Waithera for six days. The bizarre burial ceremonies had no written eulogies as villagers failed to assist in preparations. Kimani’s uncle Karanja Muiru decried the bad name that his family has gotten following the botched kidnapping.

Speakers asked the youth to refrain from crime. Pastor John Njaramba said many criminal gangs have dominated East lands estates in Nairobi, luring many youths into a life of crime. Njaramba said he is a reformed gangster and that he changed his ways after realizing that such a life would bring his life to a premature end. “I have buried many youthful people who lose their lives in crime and it is very unfortunate that they do not get to realize their full potential and positively contribute to the development of the society,” he said. The suspects were demanding a Sh 5 million from the victim's family before the police rescued her.
