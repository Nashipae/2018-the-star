The Kenya Urban Roads Authority plans to build another flyover on the Thika Superhighway to ease traffic. It will have one in Allops — the junction with Outering road. Kura chief communications officer John Cheboi on Sunday said the African Development Bank had approved its request to implement the project. “There has always been congestion at that junction. The roundabout is not adequate to ease traffic. We looked at the design of Outering Road and the Thika Super Highway and the only rational option was to construct an additional flyover,” he said. The authority said GSU headquarters had complained about traffic jams in the area and blames them for rising crime. “Near the GSU gate, there is one flyover, so we will introduce another one. The upper flyover will be used by vehicles to and from the city centre and the lower one will be specifically for motorists heading and coming from the Outering Road,” Cheboi said. Meanwhile, Kura needs three more months to complete the Outering Road. It is about 93 per cent done. Kura said the delay was partly caused by land acquisition, relocation of services and encroachment on reserves. Last week, the Environment and Land Court allowed the authority to proceed with expansion of Outering Road, where work had been stopped after a couple filed suit against the project. The 13km stretch from Taj Mall to Ruaraka will have 11 footbridges. Only one has been built in Baba Dogo.
