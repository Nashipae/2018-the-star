Nairobians seeking to use public toilets were stranded on Wednesday morning as armed police
officers surrounded them, amid a management dispute. The officers were deployed to block youths who had taken over the management of some toilets in
the CBD. The groups prevented access by those who initially ran the facilities. The deployment followed a court order obtained by the initial operators after the groups forcefully took over management in March.

Bus Station were affected by the standoff. "Goons took over these facilities illegally. That is why we
went to court ... police are here to remove them," said Tom Makale, chairman of the Public Toilets Operators Association of Kenya. There were reports that the county had taken over the toilets after
pictures of police officers manning them emerged. Environment CEC Larry Wambua and county operations
director Peter Mbaya refuted the reports and noted that police were enforcing a court order. "We are not [closely involved] with what happened. This issue
involves two groups - goons and official operators. I call
them goons because they did not apply to run the toilets," Mbaya said. Two weeks ago, Governor Mike Sonko ordered the withdrawal of charges for use of the toilets and threatened to hire a firm to run them if the management
wrangles are not addressed. Read: No free toilets yet: Sonko gives operators room to end wrangles Wambua said the county is still in the process of procuring the
firm. "Should we intend to take over, we will give a clear notice so everybody is aware," Wambua said. Click here for the latest political news
