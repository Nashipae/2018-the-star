Albert Njogu’s bid to make it to the quarters final of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) Nairobi Junior Open was dealt a blow as he succumbed 6-2, 6-1 to Aryaan Bhatia of India in the third round at Nairobi Club.
Njogu, the only remaining home boy in the singles and a beaten finalist of the Kigali Junior Open held a week ago, failed to replicate his first and second round magics and bitterly crashed out of the tournament to stall his ambition of reaching quarters and replicating the successes achieved in Rwanda.
The Form 3 student at Mbagathi Secondary School, who was the pre-match favourite, failed to live up to the billing and trailed his opponent in both sets with his returns were a major let down.
He managed to make  good use of his serves twice in the opening set but did little to catch up with the Indian opponent. Efforts by Njogu to restore parity in the second set equally flopped as his opponent subjected him to tougher serves and returns which condemned him to a 6-1 defeat. He attributed the loss to bad luck and promised to come back stronger in the second leg slated for next week.
 “It was a bad day for me.  I feel I was unlucky today. Everything did not work for me but it will not be business as usual in the second leg. I have set the finals as my target and I will use the remaining days of the week to work my weak areas.”
Despite going down in the singles, Njogu teamed up with Burundi’s top seed Abdoul Kabura in the doubles, where they silenced the Madagascar’s duo of Toky Ranaivo and Fenosa Rasendra 6-1, 6-3.
Today, top seed and the sole Kenyan remnant in the tournament, Sneha Kotecha will take on Kenyan-based Burundian Hoziane Kitambala in the girls quarter finals.
