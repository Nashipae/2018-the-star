Nyamira governor John Nyagarama is expected to resume office on Monday, after a two-month stay in the US, where he underwent treatment. The governor (pictured) will be confronted by a myriad of problems when he resumes office. Nyagarama returned last week for the burial of his eldest son George Ndemo, who died on June 11. “It has been really draining mentally and physically for the family. Doctors couldn’t believe that I wanted to cut short my treatment to attend this burial. But I had to come to see off my son,” he said in an emotional speech last week. Services at the county have been disrupted by a budget standoff between the assembly and the executive. The assembly has twice rejected the county’s Sh6.5 billion budget citing anomalies. Health workers went on a go-slow two months ago protesting delays in remitting their salaries. Yesterday, Senator Okong’o Omogeni said the situation was dire. “If things don’t change, I will ask the Senate to form a special team to probe the county,” he said.
