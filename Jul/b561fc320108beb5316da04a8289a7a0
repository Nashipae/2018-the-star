Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa met a delegation from Teso at Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong’s Okilidu home on Sunday. Eugene was accompanied by Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga and Budalang'i MP Raphael Wanjala. The CS urged NASA co-principals Moses Wetang'ula and Musalia Mudavadi to support the March 9 handshake between President Uhuru Kenya and NASA leader Raila Odinga. “It is my hope that all communities will back it. Deputy President William Ruto, Wiper leader Kalonzo and his Amani counterpart Musalia Mudavadi have welcomed it,’’ he said.

Wanjala said individuals against the handshake are enemies of the nation and that  Raila is "the only leader in Kenya who can call for a holiday which is not gazetted". The meeting came hot on the heels of one between Ruto and Ojaamong on July 20 in Busia. It was seen as a move by the DP to cement his support in the region which is widely perceived as an opposition stronghold. Ruto urged Teso residents to support his 2022 presidential bid, noting the government has initiated many projects in the region and deserves support. "The measure of any leaders is not how much they talk. It is how much they deliver," he said. Click here for the latest political news
