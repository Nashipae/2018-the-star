The department of health in Homa Bay County has outlawed the use of newspapers in packaging food items. The county health executive member Richard Muga argued newspapers have inks that contain harmful chemicals that are dangerous to human body. “The ink that is used in printing newspapers has Led substance and other chemicals that are poisonous. They are harmful if they are consumed,” Muga said. Speaking to journalists on Thursday in Homa Bay town, Muga cautioned residents against using printed materials to wrap-up their food items. Those likely to be affected by the suspension include butchery operators, fish mongers and other traders selling mandazis and chapatis. On Tuesday, the CEC ordered for a crackdown on traders who still use newspapers in packaging food items. Several traders dealing food items protested and accused the county health officials of implementing the order without giving alternative. Homa Bay Giant Traders Association secretary general Jack Nyambega said the county government ambushed them with the ban on the use of newspapers. “It’s proving hard to run food item business after the use of newspaper is outlawed. They should provide alternative since Nema had also banned the use of polythene bags,” Nyambega said. The traders threatened to stage demonstration should the health department maintain its stand. "Some health officers harass us during crackdown.They take advantage and take a way food," he added. Muga maintained that public health officers will continue conducting impromptu visits on different business places in the county to enforce the ban. He said they met the traders’ leadership and issued a 14-day notice. “People must abide by the law. When we say it is wrong for them to directly wrap up food items with newspaper we know the negative effect it has on them,” Muga said.
