A British pensioner has been sentenced to 18 years and six months in prison after evidence of child abuse in Kilifi. Keith Morris, a retired locksmith, was sentenced on July 18 for using his power to rape and sexually abuse underage girls in the coastal county. "You were a benefactor to the residents of this village, especially the children. The evidence showed the abject poverty of the inhabitants of the village. You chose the weakest of the girls in the village and preyed upon them," Leeds Crown court judge Mairs said as reported by Hull Daily Mail. The 72-year-old was found guilty of rape of a child under 16, three counts of sexual assault by penetration of a child under 16, two counts of sexual assault of a child under 16 and two counts of perverting the course of justice. He was tried in a British court following an investigation by United Kingdom's National Crime Agency (NCA) and Kenyan authorities. Investigators revealed Morris had been visiting Kilifi county, where, under the pretext of supporting local families with household goods, clothing and education. During a three-week trial in the UK, young victims gave evidence through a live video link from Mombasa. One of the victims told the court Morris, who was known to her as Mozzy, had done “bad things” to her when they stayed at a hotel. The victim said he then told her she would be in trouble if she informed anyone about it.
