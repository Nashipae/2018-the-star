A Muslim family has petitioned CJ David Maraga over the circumstances in which a Kadhi’s court issued two conflicting rulings. Ismael Mohamed accuses deputy Chief Kadhi Rashid Omar of causing confusion in the distribution of family properties by issuing two different rulings. On May, 2017, he filed an application before the Kadhi’s court in Nairobi seeking enforcement of the judgement dated April, 2017. The court ruled in his favour in November, 2017. The court directed that Mohammed be handed flat No 3 on the land in Nairobi West. The Kadhi’s Court said the allocation of the property was the product of parties consent agreement and his application was allowed. Omar directed Lang’ata police chief to ensure compliance of the orders. However, the Kadhi recalled the file and discharged his earlier orders that he had given Mohamed the property, saying the same was not allocated to him in the consent agreement of parties. The discharge order is contained in the second ruling dated November 23, 2017. It is the basis of the complaint to the CJ. Mohamed is calling for investigations of the judicial officer. He says Omar called the police who were to execute the court order to tell them the order had been set aside and no execution should take place.
