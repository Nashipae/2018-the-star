Seven students of Kisumu Girls High school were on Monday charged with malicious damage to property and creating a disturbance. They were charged with wilful and unlawful damage of 10 windows, 33 louvres, 16 doors, 9-kg fire extinguishers, and a perimeter wall - all valued at Sh2.9 million. In count two, the accused are alleged to have willfully and unlawfully damaged the rear windscreen of a vehicle belonging to Margaret Mamai - the principal. They were also charged with creating disturbance in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by shouting and throwing stones at the school buildings and neighbourhood. The minors denied the three counts, which followed the July 2 strike, when they appeared before chief magistrate Julius Ng’arng’ar. They were released on a Sh50,000 bond or Sh30,000 bail each and a surety of the same amount. The hearing is slated for August 7. On July, the school was closed indefinitely after students went on rampage. The students destroyed the principal's house and vandalised her car. They also stoned the administration block and dining hall breaking window panes. The police were called to restore calm and rescued the principal who was under siege. Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed, accompanied by KNEC chairman George Magoha, visited the school and warned students against such acts.
