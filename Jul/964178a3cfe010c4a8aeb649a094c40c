The media fraternity is yet again in mourning following the death of a People Daily reporter in an accident on Thika Superhighway. Robin Obino, of Mediamax Network Limited, was knocked down by a speeding matatu near Muthaiga police station in Nairobi at around 2 pm on Thursday. Colleagues privy to events before the incident said Obino had been following up on the story of the Ngara Girls' school girl who went missing. "He was on the beat with other colleagues who work for K24 TV but he was left behind so he took a matatu," a workmate told the Star on phone. 'It appears he alighted past where he was supposed to and was knocked down as he attempted to cross the road." Police took the body to City Mortuary. Obino's death came just a day after those of the Star's revise editor Mathew Gathigira and former Chief Sub-editor Wanjiru Kinoti.
