The 11 people arrested in Kajiado on Sunday, after police shot and killed a man, have denied the charge of attempting to commit a crime. The group was arrested by Isinya police as they chased a matatu that they termed suspicious. County Commissioner David Kipkemei said three knives, a home-made gun, five bottles of Brandy, 46 rolls of bhang and five grams of raw marijuana were recovered from the vehicle.

The suspects' lawyer asked the court to consider that some of them are minors and students. Shitubi granted them release on Sh100,000 bond each and ordered them to submit letters of employment or admission to school. One of the accused was taken to Kajiado police station pending the processing of bond documents. Shitubi said: "The case is serious therefore those who
cannot raise bond will be detained at Kajiado GK Prison until July 16
when the case will be heard." Police said the vehicle, registration number KAP 643 P, was heading to Kajiado town when its driver sped off after it was flagged down. Kipkemei said they opened fire when "suspicious people" started running away from the matatu and that it was then that the man was killed. Relatives of the 11, however, claimed that they were framed. They reportedly hired a matatu from Kiserian town and left late on Saturday night but were confronted by police at about 1 am on Sunday. “The young men had been going to perform at a concert in Bissil town near Namanga town when police started trailing them. They decided to go back and report the matter to police but the officers opened fire and killed one of them," said one who requested anonymity. Click here for the latest political news
