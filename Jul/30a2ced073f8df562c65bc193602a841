Moiben MP Silas Tiren wants the EACC to make public its findings on the Sh 1.9 billion maize purchase at the National Cereals and Produce Board. He said it has delayed payment of Sh1.4 billion to maize farmers. The payment, which was to be made this week as part of the Sh5 billion owed to farmers, has been put on hold because of investigations. Tiren said the probe was taking too long and farmers have suffered since December last year. “Let the EACC release the report so we can move forward. The farmers should be paid without further delay,” he said in Eldoret yesterday. Tiren said Uhuru should intervene. He said action must be taken against all those who may have diverted money meant to pay farmers. “We are wondering why the EACC is taking too long to release its report on the maize scandal and yet we have seen quick action in other scandals,” Tiren said. The anti-corruption commission said the report will be out in a week. Spokesman Yassin Amaro said investigations were at the tail end. Anti-corruption detectives have grilled traders and senior NCPB staff. At least Sh1.9 billion was paid to about 10 traders, while more than 3,500 farmers have yet to be paid Sh5 billion. The traders have denied claims of impropriety and said they did genuine business with the board. Finance CS Henry Rotich said Sh1.4 billion will be paid by the end of the week. Detectives camped at depots in Kisumu, Bungoma, Kitale, Eldoret, Moi’s Bridge and Nakuru.
