Government is at advanced stages to relocate the Mama Ngina Girls' Secondary School in Mombasa to an expansive land in Shimo la Tewa in Shanzu. On Tuesday, Education Principal Secretary Dr Belio Kipsang said the school management is finalizing on the architectural design of the new school, which was allocated Sh100 million by government. "The construction work is expected to start by next year January. Currently, the school board and management are working on getting the title deed for the 20 acres of land which were donated by the Shimo la Tewa Boy high school,‚Äù said Kipsang. Speaking during a tour to investigate the reason behind the recent spate of unrest and fires in schools, Kipsang said everything is moving on smoothly.
