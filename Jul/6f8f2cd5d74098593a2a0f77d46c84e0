Five thousand acres of land in Lodokenjek area of Samburu county will be dedicated for pasture production. The county government said it is going to train farmers on how they can earn income from pasture farming in areas that do not support food crop production. The county's executive committee member for Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Vincent Learman said the county has segregated some zone for livelihood resource. "As county government of Samburu we are interested in supporting our people to achieve some level of income," Said Learman. The county will support farmers in Lodokenjek ward with ploughs, certified seeds and agricultural training to make sure that they produce enough pasture. Learman announced that the county government will buy hay produced by the farmers and store for the dry season. "We will buy as the county government and store so that we will be able to support livestock from the low land areas where this pasture cannot be grown," he said. The CEC noted that, through the farmers in the dedicated zone, Samburu is set to become self-reliant in terms of pasture. However, farmers in the region have been encouraged to engage in pasture farming as an economic venture. Hassan Kello, Administrative secretary in the ministry of agriculture, the state department of crops said that the national government will support farmers willing to engage in pasture farming as a business.
