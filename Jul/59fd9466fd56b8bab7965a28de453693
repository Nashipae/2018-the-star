Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya has accused the national government of inflating the cost of medical equipment it bought for the counties. He said Kenyans do not get value for money in the deal. “Some of this equipment is bought at exorbitant prices to benefit some individuals. For example, a CT scanner can’t cost Sh150 million. My government bought the scan at Sh55 million recently,” Oparanya said. He said the national government sidestepped the counties in planning for the purchases and ended up buying equipment that already exists in the devolved unit. “We have CT scan and MRI equipment. Why are they bringing similar equipment, instead of asking us what we need?” he asked. The counties should get the cash so they buy what they lack, Oparanya said. He said the national government dumped some of the equipment in the counties at night after governors rejected them. The county chief dismissed as a public relations stunt a statement by Health PS Peter Tum that DP William Ruto did not lie about giving Kakamega Sh150 million for installing a CT scan at the county referral hospital. “Ruto said he gave me the money, yet he has never done that. If it’s the CT scan the PS is talking about, it was dumped at the hospital by the government and no one knows how much was spent on it,” he said. On Tuesday, Tum said Kakamega General Hospital is one of the 37 public facilities that will benefit from the 37 CT scanners bought by the government. He said the equipment will be ready for use by August 15 after installation. Tum said a Kakamega radiographer has been trained in China and is ready to offer services.
