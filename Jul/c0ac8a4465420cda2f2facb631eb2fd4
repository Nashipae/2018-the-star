The anti-graft body is investigating why 40 feet containers loaded with ethanol are yet to be destroyed, two years after the order. Officials tasked with the destruction are the subjects of the probe. EACC said Sh40 million worth of tax was lost in the contraband consignment. The seizure took place at MICD CFS Zain in Kibarani on Monday evening, EACC said. "We stopped the containers when it was almost released. No arrest so far and we are seeking answers as to why it wasn't destroyed through the investigation," CEO Halakhe Waqo told the Star on Tuesday. The Star was yet to be established whether the consignment was part of 63 containers of ethanol that had been reported destroyed in February 2016. Kenya Bureau of Standards had condemned the goods as unfit for consumption prior to customs auctions. On January 15, 2016, ethanol worth Sh288 million and contraband sugar valued at Sh56 million were seized in Mombasa. Click here for the latest political news
