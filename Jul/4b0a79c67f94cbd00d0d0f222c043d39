Police in Kilifi will arrest family members of the elderly should they be killed on suspicion of witchcraft. Most elderly people have been murdered after being linked to black magic. “The county security team has agreed to arrest all the family members whenever an elderly is murdered,’’ county commissioner Magu Mutindika said on Saturday. He was speaking during the official opening of a peace forum to promote cohesion and harmony among residents. The county will hold dialogues among communities to address perennial conflicts. The forum held at Kilifi Bay was organised by ACT, a local civil rights organisation. Officials of both the county and national government were present. High poverty levels, unemployment and historical injustices were cited as factors that often instigate conflicts. Kilifi was identified as one of the violence hotspots during elections. ACT official Felicia Odada said tensions were stoked during last year's elections, hence the need to sensitise residents on peace. She said politicians had started inciting their supporters against perceived rivals. "Campaigns for 2022 have started in earnest and youths are being misused by politicians," Odada said. Mutindika said the dialogue will promote cohesion. “Part of our key strategy is to institute peace committees at ward levels to deal with emerging security issues," he said. The official said they will deal with politicians inciting residents against each other. He asked the National Land Commission to hasten land adjudication processes. The dialogue forum is chaired by Kilifi ACK Bishop Lawrence Dena.
