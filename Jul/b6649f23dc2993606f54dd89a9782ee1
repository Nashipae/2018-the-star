The government will release Sh1.4billion to NCPB to pay maize farmers within the next one week. Finance CS Henry Rotich says the money will be the first payment to be done in the new financial year. Rotich said the payment for farmers is already being loaded in the IFMIS system. Maize farmers had threatened to carry out protests in Eldoret if they are not paid in one week. “We know there have been some delays but we value our farmers and I have instructed that the first payment by the government in the new financial year will be that of farmers”, said Rotich. He was speaking the Rivatex textile company on Saturday. Rotich said the financial year was closed on Saturday and farmers should not panic because they will be given priority this week. “The payment for farmers is now being loaded in the famous IFMIS system so that the relevant ministry can have the fund to pay the farmers,” said the CS.
