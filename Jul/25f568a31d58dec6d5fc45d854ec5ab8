Property worth an estimated Sh7 million went up in flames at Mokowe Secondary School in Lamu West on Thursday night. A fire destroyed a dormitory from about 8.15 pm as the boys attended evening preps. There were no casualties. All the property owned by 93 students was reduced to ashes. Lamu West OCPD Juma Londo said police went to the scene but were yet to establish the cause of the fire. A spate of school fires has left 39 schools across the country closed and 142 students arrested for various offences. Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed and all her senior officials have been all over the country, fighting and insisting that the ministry will not relent on its reforms. Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang said they partnered with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to arrest suspects linked to the widespread unrest.
