Classic 105’s Mike Mondo has revealed that he is off the market. He however did not talk much about the lucky woman. “There is someone in the picture, just that I am not in a position to talk about her or reveal who she is.” Mike, who celebrated his birthday at Cloud9 in Westlands with close friends and family at the weekend, told Word Is he has come a long way and he is grateful for where he is in life. “I organised something for my close friends and family this time round. I have learnt so much in life, like life is a bitch and parenthood is not for everyone.” Mike spent part of his special day with his two-year-old daughter, whom he says is one of the reasons he is working so hard. “I want her to be everything she wants to be. I do not want her to go through what I did growing up. I have also come to know that sometimes life will be rough, but you have to press on and remain focused.” His aim in life is to get a seven-figure income, which he believes is possible. “I have actually surpassed my target in life because I did not think I would be where I am today but I look forward to earning a seven-figure salary.” Last month Mike bought himself his most expensive birthday gift ever—the latest BMW 3 Series (E91 ), much to the envy of those who still have numbers of Uber drivers on speed dial. The BMW is a revised version of the 2006 model. Mike said he does not regret buying the new car as, “at the end of the day, pesa ni ya kutumiwa [money is meant to be spent”.
