Gospel star Size 8 has opened up about her struggles with menstrual health as a teenager, saying she had Citizen TV’s Jacque Maribe to thank for easing her burdens. Speaking to Word Is, the singer said, "Growing up was so hard for me because unlike most girls nowadays who are provided with sanitary towels by their parents, I did not have them. I used to have a very heavy flow but could not purchase more than one packet to sustain me. I would stay with one piece for so long, which I now know is unhealthy. I would visit the washrooms often to check if I had stained myself. Sometimes it was so tough that I could totally not afford [the towels]." Maribe was her dormmate at State House Girls, and they were good friends. "Jacque would give me some [sanitary pads] each time she came from home," the artiste said. She recounted days when the situation reached embarrassing levels. "I would sometimes stain myself. I would even put tissue to play the role of a sanitary pad," she said. Now a brand ambassador for Soft Care sanitary pads, Size 8 has heard sad stories from some of the teenage girls she has met. "I just feel so bad when they tell me they use improvised pads. Mtu anakata blanketi, she uses it and washes it so she can reuse it. Some even miss school. While it should be a necessity to every girl in Kenya, to them it is a luxury. Sometimes I visit them and give them pads, maybe a packet or two, and they just take them, but there is no sustainability." She looks forward to the day the government will consider sanitary pads a basic need for women and girls and even include them in education. "My prayer to the government is to find a way to sustain girls who cannot afford sanitary pads. I do my best to help those who do not have them, but I cannot manage every girl in Kenya."
