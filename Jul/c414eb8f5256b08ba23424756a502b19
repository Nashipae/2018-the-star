Elgeyo Marakwet has banned farming on parts of landslide-prone Kerio Valley to stop disasters. The county government launched a public education programme to stop illegal farming. It put up beacons on areas where farming will not be allowed. The Kerio escarpment stretches more than 100km from Keiyo South to West Pokot. Environment and Agriculture executives Abraham Barsosio and Shadrack Yatich toured Kocholwo yesterday. They said poor agriculture practices on the steep, loose-soiled escarpment are to blame for mudslides.
