Senate majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen has continued to receive warnings from fellow MPs for politicising the ongoing Mau forest evictions. Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito (pictured) has asked him to apologise for attacking President Uhuru Kenyatta and dragging former Prime Minister Raila Odinga into the ongoing Mau forest saga. Last week, the Elgeyo Marakwet senator said Uhuru’s handshake with Raila on March 9 was to blame for the Mau evictions. Speaking in Kakamega yesterday, the Shinyalu MP said Murkomen was playing cheap and dirty politics. “Murkomen should know that Raila is not his equal, not his age and not his political match,” he said.
