Businessmen at Gikomba market will not be allowed to rebuild their stalls as the government plans to construct a modern market. This comes amid fears that the frequent fire outbreaks were an act of arson to grab the land. Deputy county commissioner Moses Lilan said the affected area is a riparian reserve. “It is unfortunate we have allowed this for quite a while and it is our belief if we allowed them back we will go back to the same scenario,” he said.
