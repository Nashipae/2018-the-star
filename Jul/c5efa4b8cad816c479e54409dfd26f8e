Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga yesterday launched a water project under which 15 boreholes will be drilled. Speaking outside his office in Nyeri town, Kahiga said the project will cost Sh23.2 million. It will be jointly funded by the county government and the National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation. Twelve boreholes will be drilled in Kieni subcounty and the rest in Mathira. The construction of the boreholes is just the first of four phases of the project, Kahiga said. The boreholes will be powered through a partnership with the Rural Electrification Authority. “We intend to drill the boreholes this financial year. We’re excited that we’ll be able to connect them to solar energy,” Kahiga said.
