Former Tigania East MP Mpuru Aburi has thrown his weight behind Deputy President William Ruto. He denied Jubilee is divided over the DP’s 2022 presidential bid. Aburi, an East African Legislative Assembly MP, said he and the Meru community support the DP’s bid. “That was the deal Ruto and President Uhuru Kenyatta signed when they formed Jubilee in 2012,” he said. “That was the succession plan and there is no argument or compromise about it. As a community we are with him.” The EALA lawmaker said Jubilee is united, contrary to reports of division rocking the ruling party over Ruto’s quest for the country’s top seat. “Jubilee is one under the leadership of the President and his principal assistant, who is the Deputy President. We should be united to realise the vision we had when we came together,” he told the Star yesterday. Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen has said there are individuals in the Office of the President frustrating Ruto’s bid. Some politicians from Central have been quoted telling the DP not to expect automatic support from the community. Aburi, a former Tigania East MP, also praised Uhuru on his unity pact with NASA leader Raila Odinga. He said the President’s move to elevate the ODM leader to a statesman and tasking Ruto with overseeing development will unify the country. “Raila is free to build the country’s image and look for investors abroad to grow our economy as he is doing now. The DP, on the other hand, is free to ‘tanga tanga’ and launch development projects,” Aburi said. Raila has been representing the State in various functions abroad since his famous ‘handshake’ with the President on March 9. The deal between the two rivals has brought relative calm and tranquility after the highly-contested and divisive last year’s election. The President’s victory was overturned by the Supreme Court but he was re-elected in a repeat poll in October.
