A man was shot dead in
Burnt Forest on Saturday following a violent clash between youths and police. Eldoret East police boss Richard Omanga an OCS was forced to fired into the air to disperse the youth who were throwing stones at him. It is not clear who shot the victim. “We have handed
over the matter to DCI for investigation. We don't know if it’s the OCS who
shot him," Omanga said. Senior police officers
visited the area following the killing. They blamed the OCS for the shooting. The tragedy happened after the youths confronted officers who had arrested a youth on claims of selling drugs. The youths protested the arrest, demanding the release of their colleague whom they said was a well-known sweet vendor. “It became difficult
for the officers to take the suspect into custody. They were forced to call the OCS for reinforcement," Omanga said. The youths hurled stones at the OCS as he arrived on the scene. "We will give a detailed information once investigations are complete," Omanga said. Angry residents blocked the Eldoret-Nakuru highway, demanding action against the OCS. “We're urging residents to remain calm. The matter is under proper investigations," Omanga said.
