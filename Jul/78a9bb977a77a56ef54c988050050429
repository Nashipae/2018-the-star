The debate is raging on whether a hotel in Kericho was justified to kick out Laikipia Woman Representative Catherine Waruguru and her husband William Kiget for failing to produce a marriage certificate. Two women leaders from Garissa have accused the hotel owners of being unreasonable. Sunshine Upperhill Hotel revoked the couple’s reservation for failing to produce their marriage certificate. The hotel has a strict policy requiring couples to produce a marriage certificate before they can be accommodated. Speaking separately to the Star on Friday, nominated MCAs Amran Mohamed and Fatuma Sanweine said the action was not only an infringement on the couple’s privacy, but was also meant to demean women. “I am a married woman and I have slept in several hotels but I never came across such a hotel asking for a marriage certificate. After all, no couple walks around with their marriage certificate,” Mohamed said. “The Kericho hotel should have respected the Laikipia woman rep as a leader. Their action is an embarrassment to the hotel industry.” The MCA urged the courts to treat the matter as an issue of national interest and give it the seriousness it deserves. Supkem national organising secretary Abdullahi Salat said among the Muslim, it is assumed a man and a woman who want spend a night at a hotel are legally married. Lantern hotel manger George Ochieng’ said although the establishment does not have “extreme” policies, it does not allow “every Tom, Dick and Harry into our facility”. “We use our discretion to differentiate a true couple and a fake one. In many instances, unmarried men and women respect our facility and keep off,” he said. Waruguru said the incident embarrassed her and said she will raise the matter in Parliament. “We will not allow any more married women and men to suffer embarrassment at the hand of hospitality industry players,” she said.
