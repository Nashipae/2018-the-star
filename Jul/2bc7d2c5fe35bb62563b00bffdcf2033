Nakuru MCAs have passed a motion to compel hotels and private investors to open corridors for the public to access Lake Naivasha. The corridors provide easy access to the beach and to social facilities, including schools. Some children walk for more than 5km to reach school due to the obstruction. Lakeview ward rep Karanja Mburu who moved the motion said members of the public are forced to travel for 30km because hotels have blocked easier access routes.  IMPUNITY Majority leader Stanley Karanja said the lake is a natural resources that should be enjoyed by everyone and not a select few. “We ask the county’s department of Planning, Trade and Tourism to open the corridors. The public relies on the lake for their livelihood,” he said. “This is impunity of the highest order”, Karanja said. The ward representatives said opening of the corridors would improve security in the area. Residents have taken issue with the slow pace of reopening of the blocked corridors. “Some investors have encroached on riparian land, and this is affecting the ecosystem of the lake,” resident Peter Kamau said. Naivasha residents cannot access the lake as nearly all the corridors have been closed by flower farm owners and hoteliers,” the resident said. He said many traders make a living from the beach. Last year, there was drama in Naivasha when furious members of the public forcibly opened a blocked road leading to the lake. The group opened the corridor near YMCA camp and scolded one of investors for blocking it for years. The protestors said they were harassed and blocked from accessing the lake by managers of flower farms. Anti-riot police watched from a distance as the group, mainly former workers of Karuturi Flower Farm, took space on the shores of the lake ready to start their businesses.
