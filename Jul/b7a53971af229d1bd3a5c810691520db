Deputy President William Ruto has said it is time sports was treated like any other economic activity in Kenya. He said while sports is a key contributor to the gross domestic product of some countries across the globe, Kenyans were still perceiving it as a leisure activity. Speaking at the St Mary’s School-Nairobi on Sunday evening during the finals of the inaugural under-16 Wanyama Cup football tournament, the DP called on the youths to mimic the Kenyan international Victor Wanyama and his brother McDonald Mariga. “These two men are our heroes. They have shown that Kenya is not only home to athletics but also soccer. I applaud you for supporting the youths in exploiting their football talent,” Ruto said. The DP said sports was a powerful platform for uniting Kenyans, besides preventing young people from engaging in criminal activities. “Now, youths should treat sports as a productive activity that can empower them economically,” he said. Citing the blossoming English Premier League, US Major League Baseball and the National Football League (American Football),Ruto noted that Kenya also stands to boost its revenues from soccer, athletics, rugby, among other sports.
