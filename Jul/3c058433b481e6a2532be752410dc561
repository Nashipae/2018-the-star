Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has renamed Ngara Ring Road to Dr Geoffrey William Griffin Road in honour of the Founding Director of Starehe Boys Centre. Griffin, who founded the school in 1959 with the help of the late Geoffrey Gatama Geturo and Joseph Kamiru Gikubu, died in June 2005 after battling colon cancer for about one year.

This will be done with immediate effect,” he said. The ceremony was attended by British High Commissioner Nic Hailey, Starehe Boys Centre Director Josphat Mwaura and several MPs among them Celeb Amisi MP of Saboti constituency. Sonko celebrated Dr. Griffin as a man whose wisdom and ambition in establishing the institution impacted positively on the lives of thousands. He said Starehe Boys Centre has become the symbol of excellence, hard work and discipline that other schools should emulate to avoid the emerging and unfortunate trend of student unrest. “Let me offer a word of advice to our students; the parents and guardians have sacrificed for you to be in school because it’s a better option to arm you with education as an inheritance,” said Sonko.

At the same time, Sonko said it is not right for student’s future to be decided by a two-hour examination. He advocated for the use of continuous assessment tests to grade students. "Schools should look for the strength in every child and enhance it. If a student is strong in music, he should be encouraged to do music; if a student is strong in sciences, that is what should be promoted,” Sonko said. He said in Nairobi, they have taken education seriously. “We are the only county that now offers free Early Childhood Development Education, and each ECDE pupil receives Sh3,500. We recently launched full scholarships for 60,000 secondary school students. We are also investing heavily in our Technical and Vocational Training institutions,” Sonko said. Hailey lauded the commitments the county government of Nairobi has put in place especially in the education sector. “The county government of Nairobi has done a lot especially when it comes to matters of education. Lets take studies with seriousness,”he said. More: Honouring role-model heroes a good idea Click here for the latest political news
