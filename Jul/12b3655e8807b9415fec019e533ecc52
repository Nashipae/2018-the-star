Public Service CAS Rachael Shebesh on Thursday said too few women in Kisii take loans from the Women Enterprise Fund. She said she does not understand why women from the region fear taking loans. Shebesh encouraged the women to form groups and apply for loans to enable them expand their businesses. “I have noted with concern that the number of women in Kisii who obtain loans from WEF is so small compared to other regions,” she said. The CAS spoke at Kisii Sports Club, where she distributed cheques worth Sh5.6 million to 18 women’s groups drawn from nine constituencies. She was accompanied by Kisii Woman Representative Janet Ong’era, deputy governor Joash Maangi and county commissioner Godffrey Kigochi. Shebesh said in Kiambu, Nyeri, Kakamega and Bungoma counties, women have formed groups and obtained loans. “Women groups in the mentioned counties are active in doing various businesses that is why they obtain big loans,” the CAS said. She said President Uhuru Kenyatta has the interest of the Kenyans women at heart because they play a key role in the economic growth. Ong’era urged women to register more self-help groups so they can apply for loans. She told the women not to fear taking loans, because they are given a period to repay.
