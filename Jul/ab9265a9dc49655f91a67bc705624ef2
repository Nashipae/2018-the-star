Gems Cambridge International School in Nairobi has denied claims of racial discrimination and intimidation of Kenyan staff. Local staff last month asked the government to audit the school's operations, saying they were openly discriminated against and often intimidated. GEMS Africa CEO Sukwinder Bassi yesterday said all international staff have met all requisite immigration demands. “We were very disappointed to read what we saw. We are a 60-year-old education provider, whose basis revolves around human values. We are committed to being fair, respectful and treating everyone with dignity,” Bassi said. He blamed former workers for making up fabrications. “Those who fail to meet our highest standards and are let go are the ones who react by making up all sorts of allegations which are unjustified and untrue,” he said. He denied claims that the school was engaging international staff who work on special passes that are occasionally renewed to keep them in Kenya. Bassi said all their foreign staff had work permits and that the school was committed to observing Kenya's laws. He said the school has 80 per cent local staff. The teaching staff is made up of 50 per cent foreigners. Bassi said some of specialised skills in English, Maths, Art and Technology were still lacking locally hence the need to hire foreigners. He said they were paying Kenyan workers more than what other international schools offer. He did not disclose the salary figures. On pay disparities between local and international staff without giving figures he said GEMS school was top payers of local staff compared to what other international schools pay their teachers in the country. The CEO encouraged staff to take advantage of the frequent survey on staff satisfaction to raise their grievances.
