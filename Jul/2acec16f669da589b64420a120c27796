ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi wants politicians to stop using government projects as a campaign tool. He also cautioned MPs to stop supporting  2022 presidential candidates in exchange for development goodies. Mudavadi said lawmakers must understand their role in Parliament is to allocate resources to support nationwide projects. “It’s MPs who appropriate the budget. Cash goes to specific projects. Therefore it is cheeky for MPs to claim they are associating with an individual for development,” Musalia said in an interview. He was reacting to Deputy President William Ruto’s series of rallies. Members of Parliament have been seen parading at the DP’s meetings  and endorsing his 2022 presidential bid. “ It beats logic to applaud someone to gain projects. You are  same people who allocated resources in Parliament,” he said.
