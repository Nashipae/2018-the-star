Three people died on Monday morning when the motorcycle they were on was involved in an accident on Sagana-Karatina road. Mwea West OCPD Joseph Matiko said the rider collided with an oncoming private car while trying to overtake a lorry. The accident took place at Karima area as the rider headed to Karatina. Matiko said the three died at the scene while a fourth person, who was also on the boda boda, suffered injuries and was taken to Sagana Sub-county hospital. He was later transferred to Kerugoya Level Five Hospital. The bodies were taken to the mortuary at the Kerugoya facility. "Boda boda riders should observe traffic rules," the OCPD said. "Most of them ride carelessly and don't observe traffic rules leading to many accidents, most which are fatal." A rider and his three passengers died in April after he collided with a private car on Kagio-Sagana road. In May, three other people died on Kerugoya-Baricho road in an accident involving a matatu and a boda boda. Click here for the latest political news
