Maranda High School was closed indefinitely on Wednesday due to unrest by students who accused the administration of frustrating them. Notices of a strike were found at the institution and security was tightened following the closure order by the Siaya County education director. Learners who spoke to the Star accused new principal Edwin Namachanga of not listening to their concerns, making their stay difficult. They said their proposals, for changes including better meals and adjustments to the times for preps, had been ignored. "The meals are poor and we are always forced to sleep late and wake up as early as 3 am," said one who sought anonymity. Others said Namachanga should be transferred. Addressing journalists shortly after the closure, education director Masibo Kutui said they took the action to prevent a strike. "With the tension at the school, learning had not been taking place," he said. "We will let them know when to report back." Investigations were launched for facts on the causes of the unrest. Maranda is one of the schools that has put Siaya on the map due to exemplary performance in KCSE examinations. It is the fourth school to be closed this week, after Kisumu Girls', Ng'iya Girls' and Chalbi Boys. In September 2012, the institution was closed after a dormitory fire.
