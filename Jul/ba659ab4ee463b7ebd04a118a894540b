City Hall should tread carefully on calls to terminate contracts with electronic revenue collection firm JamboPay because the move could plunge the county into a financial ditch, the ICT committee has said. The committee warned the county risks going back to the manual system characterised by revenue losses as it has not put in place any alternative plans or installed any systems for seamless takeover from JamboPay. Chairman Osman Adow said City Hall also risks paying the company millions of shillings for premature termination of a legal contract. “The county government currently has not arranged or hired another company. So, if the contract is terminated, then it will affect the county government’s ability to collect revenue, which is not good for the county since we need revenue for development,” Adow said. He was referring to a report by Public Accounts Committee in May that recommended the county government terminate the contract, saying it got a raw deal. But Adow said his committee has carried out technical investigations on the PAC report regarding the revenue collection by the firm. “We have found out that the company hasn’t done anything wrong. We also found out that they have the capacity to provide that service. It is a big company that is all over East Africa,” he said. “I would just urge my colleagues in the county assembly to stop making accusations and unfounded rumours but rather engage and be taken through the system and how the company operates so that they can understand how revenue is collected.”
