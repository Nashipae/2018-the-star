The Kisumu assembly has passed a motion compelling commercial institutions to provide washrooms for their clients. The motion was filed by Kisumu West ward representative Paul Okiri. Okiri urged the MCAs to compel the health department to come up with a policy on this provision. He cites commercial banks and supermarkets in noting that queuing can be uncomfortable in the absence of washrooms. Okiri also urged the department of public works to design all public recreational centres, markets and bus parks with the disabled in mind. The MCAs supported his motion saying they had received complaints. They said the proposals should be implemented fully. “We will all benefit if the motion is implemented,” Nominated MCA Caren Muga said. Click here for the latest political news
