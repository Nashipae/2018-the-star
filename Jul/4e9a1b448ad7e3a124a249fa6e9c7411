ODM has dismissed as false, reports from Migori county officials alluding that former Cabinet minister Ochilo Ayacko has won the Senate ticket for the October 8 by-election. The party, in a tweet, reported that the National Elections Board has cautioned party officials "against giving false
information to the media and attempting to usurp roles not within
their mandate." ODM said reports quoting Migori county chairman Philip
Makabong'o regarding the Migori Senator race are untrue and should
be ignored. This followed after Makabong'o and his team announced that Ayacko had won the first stage of the nomination process via an electoral college vote. The team announced that the former Sports minister got 44 of 70 votes, results which were to be presented to the ODM National Executive Council for the unveiling of the candidate on July 26. However, ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna in a statement on Monday said the National Elections Board is reviewing applications from eight contestants. Sifuna said this is to ensure conformity and compliance with the party's election and nomination rules. "The board further sought the Central Committee's approval to issue a direct nomination to one of the eight
applicants in view of the time and resource constraints." Sifuna said the Committee approved the request and directed the NEB to nominate a
candidate from among the applicants. The name of the
nominee will then be forwarded to the National Executive Committee by Thursday July 26, 2018 for approval.
