The Nakuru county's health executive has been appointed the new chief executive officer for the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. Dr Jonah Manjari Mwangi's appointment was announced Monday by the Kemsa board session chairman Andrew Onyach. Manjari will succeed Fredrick Wanyonyi, who was serving in an acting capacity from December 2017. Onyach said Dr Manjari is an experienced advisor in the health industry and best suited to lead the authority in its next phase of growth. “We have selected a strong leader at a time when Kemsa is expected to effectively support the Ministry of Health in implementing Universal Health Care coverage by providing quality medical supplies,” Onyach said Monday at the Kemsa headquarters in Nairobi's Industrial Area. Dr Manjari expressed gratitude for the appointment and promised to lead the authority to fulfill its mandate of procuring, warehousing and distribution of medical commodities to public health facilities. “Kemsa is a premier organisation with a big mandate and we must ensure that we do our best to fulfill it,” he said. Before joining Nakuru, Dr Manjari left a legacy in Kiambu County - where he also served as health executive under Governor William Kabogo - by transforming the health sector. He spearheaded the upgrading of Kiambu and Gatundu Level Four hospitals to Level Five status. During his tenure, he oversaw the construction of new health facilities and ensured all maternity wings in all health centres across Kiambu County were fully functional. Dr Manjari holds a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery from the University of Nairobi. He also has a Masters in ENT Surgery from UoN and over 20 years work experience. Dr Manjari is the pioneer medical doctor to ever serve in the role of Chief Executive Officer at Kemsa. Click here for the latest political news
