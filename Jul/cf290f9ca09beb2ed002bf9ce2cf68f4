In the visitor's book, the Senator wrote: “Ford Kenya and Wiper share similar ideas for the future of this great country. We remain committed and connected." Kalonzo said he will continue to be the glue that holds the coalition together and that he will spare no effort in keeping his "brothers in good talking terms for the prosperity and peace of the nation". The other member of the National Super Alliance is Musalia Mudavadi, who is the leader of Amani National Congress. NASA's troubles were worsened when Raila resolved to work with President Uhuru Kenyatta. His co-principals termed him a traitor as he left them out of the talks. Kalonzo has since declared support for President Uhuru Kenyatta's agenda and his war against corruption.
