The opening of a new unga factory in Bungoma has raised the hopes of maize farmers who believe the firm will end their exploitation by middlemen. CAN Unga Mill Limited, established by a local investor, has promised to directly buy maize from farmers at improved prices. Production manager Leaky Owango yesterday said they buy a 90kg bag at Sh2,200. The middlemen pay Sh1,900 for a bag. ‘’It’s a relief to local farmers who have suffered for along at the hands of exploitative middlemen,” Owango said. Owango said the miller will process foods for dairy livestock. The miller currently produces 20 bales of flour per day. Farmers will be trained on modern technologies to improve yields. "We have recruited farmers for the training. We also want to start producing poultry foods," Owango said.
