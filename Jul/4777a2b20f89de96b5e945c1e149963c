For the second time in as many years, the crown prince of rumba, Fally Ipupa, will
shut down Nairobi with his Afro-fused blend of rhumba, hip hop and RnB. A live performance of his new album Tokooos, will enthrall Kenyan and African music lovers. This is Fally Ipupa’s fourth solo album, and the most ambitious in years. With Tokooos, Fally is attempting to take his style, deeply rooted in Congolese rumba, mainstream. The event is organised by Aces & Light Events, the company behind the Don Moen NWC in 2008, and managers of the TGR Fest with Cassper Nyovest. It will feature a one-of-a-kind VVIP section that shall include free food and drinks — a first in the Nairobi event space.
