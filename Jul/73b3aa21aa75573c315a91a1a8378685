A Chama Cha Uzalendo leader has told Coast MPs who are backing Deputy President William Ruto's 2022 presidential bid to respect their parties. Speaking to journalists on Friday at Kona ya Musa, Chama Cha Uzalendo chairman Richard Onsongo said even though he supports development, leaders should learn to strengthen parties. "Working with other leaders is not wrong, however, some MP are going overboard," Onsongo said. He asked MPs who have publicly declared their support for Ruto to resign and seek fresh mandate on a Jubilee ticket. "Political parties have different ideologies. MPs should respect the parties that sponsored them to Parliament," Onsongo said. But former senator aspirant Mshenga Ruga opposed Onsongo. He said party ideologies are not respected in Kenya, and politicians are free to form alliances for as long there is development. "MPs have a right to support Jubilee even if they were elected on an ODM ticket, but the partnership should benefit residents," he said. Ruga said even if the MPs resigned, they would be re-elected. He said Kwale governor Salim Mvurya was re-elected after decamping from ODM. "If it was possible for the governor to win the election against strong opposition, so can the MPs should they decide to resign. Party politics is now over," Ruga said.
