The pretrial of the fraud case against Gatundu North deputy county commissioner Fredrick Muli will be held in a Kitui court on August 2. Muli and Gibson Kanyi are facing charges of arbitrarily falouting procurement rules in 2013 when they served as Kitui county government officers. Kitui principal magistrate
Johnston Munguti yesterday said a hearing date will be set during the pretrial conference. Muli was the interim Kitui county secretary while Kanyi served as
the head of the supply chain. They
are accused of violating procurement rules in the purchase of two vehicles. Muli, who first appeared in court on Tuesday, was returned yesterday.  he had been given a Sh1 million bond with two sureties of a similar amount but was unable to pay. He is being held at the Kitui GK prison. Kanyi, 61,  was released on a bond of Sh800,000 with sureties of similar amount.
Lawyer Brian Macharia, who was representing the two, said Kanyi was a senior
citizen enjoying retirement and would not abscond hearings. Munguti ordered the accused to deposit their
passports with the court. He directed that the two should not have contact  with witnesses. Prosecution said the two jointly and willfully failed to comply with procurement regulations by buying the vehicles without a purchase requisition on August 27, 2013. The purchase was done withouth the approval of the tender committee.
