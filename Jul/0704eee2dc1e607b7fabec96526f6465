 Forty three witnesses including IFMIS officers from Treasury, bank officials, contractors and document examiners will testify in the Sh468 million NYS scandal.The prosecution yesterday told a pretrial conference at the Milimani chief magistrate’s court the documents include statements from expert witnesses.“The prosecution case will be supported by a bundle of documents marked from number 1 to 49,” lawyer Jalson Makori said.At least 54 suspects have been charged with the loss of funds at the National Youth Service. The suspects were present at the pretrial hearings before chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti.Makori said each witness is expected to take at least two hours.The prosecution is however yet to supply some documents including bank statements which they said will be ready in seven days.The evidence will be oral, documentary and electronic.Makori said the prosecution will rely on 22 ministerial statements and handing over notes retrieved from original contractors’ witness statements.Former PS Lilian Omollo’s lawyer Stephen Ligunya said he had received 35 copies of witness statements.There are 10 different files. The court will deal with each independently.The suspects face multiple charges including conspiracy to commit an offence of economic crime and abuse of office.  They are also charged with fraudulent acquisition of public property and approving payments of goods and services not supplied.Other charges include willful failure to comply with procedures on guidelines relating to the management of public funds.The court was on Tuesday forced to delay the hearing after the defence and the prosecution differed on the process.Blame games and excuses dominated the hearing as the two accused each other of being unwilling to compromise.Ogoti adjourned the hearing. Ten of the accused, including four members of the Ngirita family, are yet to raise bond set by the High Court last month.Yesterday, they moved to the High Court seeking a review of the bail terms, saying they were unable to comply with the stringent conditions.
