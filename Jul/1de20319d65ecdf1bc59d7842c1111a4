The Law Society of Kenya will partner with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission in the war against money laundering. LSK president Allen Gichuhi said on Friday the society met with the EACC last week and they will develop useful guidelines so its members comply with financial regulations. “We don’t want to hear that our members have been held by the police for questioning regarding money laundering,” Gichuhi said. He was speaking to lawyers during a luncheon for LSK members at the White Rhino Hotel in Nyeri town. “Hopefully, within the next three to four months, we will come up with proper guidelines. They will inform us to be on the lookout for clients who may use us on the pretext of purchasing land or making other transactions,” Gichuhi said.

Gichuhi said countries like the United Kingdom have good guidelines they can borrow from. “It is a new phenomenon in Kenya. We don’t want to be left behind. It is also one of the standards of protecting the profession and members of the public,” Gichuhi said. “Many of lawyers are innocent victims. We may not know we’ve committed acts of money laundering.” The LSK will train its members and its standards and practice committee will come up with the strategy to safeguard the society. The LSK will disburse Sh38 million to its branches and sub-brances for their operations. In the past, only Sh8 million was allocated. It was passed in a resolution during its AGM. Nyeri chairman Wahome Gikonyo welcomed the disbursement. Gichuhi said the cash will be increasing based on the number of members. “It’s not a static figure. Next year the fund will go beyond Sh30 million because of additional members,” he said. Click here for
