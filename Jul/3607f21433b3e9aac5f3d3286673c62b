2009 Kenyan Premier League champions Sofapaka consolidated their second spot in the league with a 3-2 win over Mathare United at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos yesterday. Evergreen Kepha Aswani drew first blood for Sofapaka after nine minutes from Elly Asieche’s cross to take his tally to nine this season. However, the former AFC Leopards and Nakumatt forward was withdrawn minutes later with an injury paving way for a youthful Teddy Osok. Mathare responded through Francis Omondi in the 18th minute from the spot after Dennis Odhiambo handled the ball in the box. The former Thika United skipper was adjudged to have handled Samuel Olwande’s cross in the area and Omondi made no mistake as he sent Wycliffe Kasaya the wrong way to restore parity. The goal was his sixth this season, all coming from the spot. Sofapaka regained the lead in the 31st minute through Asieche, who slotted home a penalty kick after Mathare’s gloveman, David Okello brought Pistone Mutamba down while desperately trying to stop him in a one-on-one situation. With first choice penalty taker Mathias Kigonya not available, Asieche assumed the role. A poor offside trap mounted by Mathare was well punished by Mutamba in the 48th minute before substitute Alphonce Ndonye pulled one back for Mathare minutes later. At Sudi Stadium, hosts Nzoia Sugar’s search for a first win after parting ways with their head coach Bernard Mwalala was postponed as they were held to a barren draw by visiting Posta Rangers. Debutant John Kamau’s solitary goal earned Tusker a 1-0 win over Nakumatt at Ruaraka. The former Nairobi City Stars winger scored in the 20th minute. At Camp Toyoyo, Vihiga United will have Christopher Masinza to thank as his 59th minute goal is all what they needed to overpower Wazito. Oscar Wamalwa’s 88th minute goal saw Ulinzi Stars share the spoils with visiting Kariobangi Sharks at Afraha.
