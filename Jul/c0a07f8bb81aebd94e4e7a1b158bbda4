Reuben Githinji / The government has been urged to prosecute prominent personalities who grabbed large pieces of the disputed Mwea settlement scheme land.
Embu Council of Elders, Nyangi Ndiiriri, on Saturday said a month ago it presented a list of prominent people who irregularly acquired large tracts of the 44,000 acres. Thereafter there were deadly clashes and one person was shot dead by police.
Led by council chairman Andrew Ireri, the elders said they presented the “list of shame” to Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, his land counterpart Farida Karoney, Attorney General Paul Kihara, the National Land Commission, the county commissioner and the National Intelligence Service. They requested investigation.
Ireri said if the government does not arrest and prosecute the alleged grabbers, they will file a petition at the High Court to force it to do so.
Speaking at an elders’ meeting at Nembure shopping centre, Ireri said the names were submitted on June 11 and the documents stamped. They have not received a response. The list names high-ranking figures, including businessmen, MPs, civil servants, private practitioners, farmers and prominent elders.
Ireri said those named used their influence to illegally acquire land and deny it to deserving squatters who had been living there for decades. He said the law was not followed in the land’s distribution.
Ireri said the VIPs got land in the names of their wives, children, other relatives and clan members.  In April, the government suspended resettlement of squatters and called for a review of allocation.
