Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya has urged Opposition leader Raila Odinga to support his presidential bid in 2022. Oparanya said he supported Raila for the presidency since 2007 but he did not clinch the seat. “I told Raila I have been his faithful supporter for more than 15 years, but he did not succeed. Support me because maybe your luck can come through me,” he said. Oparanya has declared he will run for the top job in in 2022 on the ODM ticket after serving his final term as governor. The governor spoke during the burial of Nicholas Opwora in Matungi subcounty on Saturday. Oparanya said that on June 26, Raila assured him of his support for the top seat as long as he unified Western. A section of Nyanza ODM leaders have been pushing to have Raila on the ballot in 2022. ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna on June 7 said Oparanya and he were strategically positioned in ODM and would convince Raila to back a Luhya candidate. He spoke during the burial service for former Kenya Sugar Board chairman Francis Chahonyo at Hombala Secondary School.
