Consumers Federation of Kenya has said electricity tariffs may not come down anytime soon unless Kenya Power reduces its budget for projects by 25 per cent. It said the utility firm’s Sh131 billion budget and procurement of faulty transformers are to blame for high tariffs because the cost is transferred to consumers. This was discussed yesterday during a stakeholders’ meeting in Naivasha whose agenda was the planned review of tariffs by Kenya Power. Ten counties were represented. Cofek secretary general Stephen Mutoro said Kenya Power had failed to give a breakdown of its budget despite requests from stakeholders. “As long as the funds for power generation remain high, consumers will continue to pay high power tariffs to offset the expenses and we are opposed to this,” he said. Mutoro said Kenya Power should address the issue of power sub-stations saying they are unequally distributed with some counties benefitting more than others. Kenya Power general manager in charge of business strategy Peter Mungai defended the company saying all the transformers were standard. He said the ongoing public participation would help make a decision on whether to increase or decrease the tariffs by the end of the month. “Our consumers have increased from 2.5 million two years ago to 6.5 million and their input will be considered before the tariffs are reviewed,” he said. ERC’s Mueni Mutunga said no decision has been made yet on the proposed new tariffs.
