Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has reinstated Vesca Kangogo as Devolution and Public Service Management executive. Sonko suspended Kangogo on June 5 for alleged insubordination; she was accused of traveling to the US without his permission. According to the suspension letter signed by County Secretary Peter Kariuki, Kangogo travelled on June 1 despite the Governor's instruction against it. "Your failure to obey lawful instructions from your appointing authority is tantamount to insubordination and therefore, you are hereby directed to step aside from your duties and responsibilities," the letter stated.

Kariuki did not respond to calls to confirm the reinstatement but Governor Press Service Director Elkana Jacob told the Star that this was the case. Reached for comment, the county executive committee member said: "God is faithful. I look forward to being of good service to Nairobians and Governor Sonko’s administration." Kangogo was moved to the Devolution docket in a cabinet reshuffle in February. She had been in charge of Finance and Economic Planning. Kangogo served as the vice chairperson of the Public Service Board in former Governor Evans Kidero’s administration. She was the second CEC to be suspended by the Governor. In February, Sonko suspended Finance CEC Danvas Makori for working with his political enemies. Makori was later sacked.
