A petition against former Meru Woman Representative Florence Kajuju has been dismissed by a Parliamentary committee. The National Assembly Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs said a memoranda filed by Prof Lawrence Mbijiwe challenging the nomination of Kajuju as the chairperson of the Commission on Administrative Justice had been set aside. Chairman and Baringo North MP William Cheptumo said the memoranda touches on land issues and did not comply with the law. But he told Kajuju, should she be appointed, she should act on the petition. Kajuju promised she will ensure court decisions against the State pending at the office of the Attorney General are hastened. She spoke during her vetting by the National Assemblyâ€™s Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs at Parliament Buildings.
