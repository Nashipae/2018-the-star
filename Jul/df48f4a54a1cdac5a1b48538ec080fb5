The Building Bridges taskforce has asked the public for practical views on how to tame corruption. In a statement on Wednesday, secretariat heads Martin Kimani and Paul Mwangi said countrywide consultations will begin soon. They said the team will hold discussions with organisations that will take part in a conference on taming graft. The conference had been set for August 6-8 but was pushed to a dates that are yet to be announced. Kimani and Mwangi pointed out that this will allow more time for the public's views to be collected. “The conference seeks to open a space for citizens to be heard clearly in this important national moment," the statement read. "The taskforce is convinced that combating corruption will entail the creation of conditions for individual citizens, groups and communities to set the cultural and social conditions that uphold integrity, honour and constitutional values." The secretariat will receive written memoranda and other information from the public on its nine-point agenda that includes how to deter corruption in all the social, economic and governance sectors. “The aim of the submissions will be best considered if they provide solutions on how Kenyans and Kenya can build lasting unity by tackling challenges articulated in the joint communique." The taskforce said the submissions should clearly outline the policy, administrative reform proposals and implementation modalities for each identified challenge. “It should be noted that the taskforce shall pay special attention to proposals for practical interventions that will change current attitudes, entrench honorable behaviour, integrity and inclusivity in leading social sectors,” the statement noted.
