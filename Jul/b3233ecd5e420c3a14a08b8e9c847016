About 20 al Shabaab militants were prevented from attacking an AP camp in Amey, in the border town of Liboi, on Tuesday morning. Garissa County Commissioner Joshua Chepchieng’ said the terrorists intended to attack police at about 2 am but were kept at bay as they have been alert. “We have information that the militants have been planning to attack the camp and other key installations along the border,” Chepchieng’ said. He denied reports that some officers went missing and that others got injured in the heavy gunfire with the attackers. “No firearms were stolen and the militants did not take the police Land Cruiser as alleged," he told journalists in his office. The administrator reported, however, that the militants partially destroyed a Safaricom mast, weakening mobile phone communication in the area. “We have dispatched a team of officers to reinforce the camp and pursue the attackers," adding aerial surveillance was taking place. The militants have been targeting police on patrol, camps and masts in their attacks along the border. The mobile service provider is currently repairing its masts in Ijara following extensive damage in attacks last. The repairs began after police assured that security had been beefed up. North Eastern Regional Commissioner Mohamud Saleh said that to enhance their security, the masts will be put up near security camps. Click here for the latest political news
