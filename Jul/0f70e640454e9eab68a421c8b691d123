IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati yesterday said they have no quorum concerns. He said the agency is constitutionally fit to perform its roles. This is a sharp departure from Chebukati’s last month admission that the commission “is properly constituted but lacks quorum for the plenary”, the policy making organ of the electoral body. The IEBC Act says five commissioners form a plenary quorum, but the agency is constituted with at least three commissioners. Chebukati told the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee of the National Assembly that they sought legal opinion from a external and internal lawyers and are convinced they are constitutionally fit to carry all the functions, including by-elections. He was accompanied by commissioners Boya Molu and Abdi Guliye. The IEBC boss told the MPs they have merged the commission’s seven committees into four and redistributed themselves with each committee having at least two members. He said Article 250 of the Constitution provides that a commission shall be complete with between three to nine commissioners, while Parliament will be responsible for setting the actual number. Chebukati said the IEBC schedule that sets quorum to at least five commissioners would only be relevant had Parliament set the number at the maximum nine.
