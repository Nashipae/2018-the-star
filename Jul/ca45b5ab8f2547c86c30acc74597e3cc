The family of a two-year-old baby who allegedly died in theatre at Kisumu County Hospital is demanding justice. Dolphine Awuor, the baby’s mother, wants a probe into the death. She said yesterday her son Curtis Martin had an overdose of anaesthesia drugs. Martin died on Friday last week. Awuor, a nurse, said he had not been operated on. County health chief officer Dickens Onyango yesterday said they had launched investigations. “We’re looking into it and will give a comprehensive report when we are done,” he said. The body is at the hospital’s mortuary, awaiting a postmortem. Awuor and her family live in Kilo, Nyalenda estate. The baby had a growth in his stomach — a condition called umbilical hernia — and the medics recomended surgery.

This was an indication they overdosed him,” she said. Awuor said there were delays and the baby was not taken to theatre as was scheduled by the facility for the morning. “At 3.30pm, they came to take the baby. They dressed him in theatre attire and told me to carry him. I signed the consent form so he be operated on,” she said. “At the theatre, an anesthetist came with two syringes. The baby was crying. They took him and told me to go and wait in the ward. After a short while, I was told Martin was dead.” Awuor said the doctor “made an incision” on top of the baby’s umbilical cord when they realised he had died to make it appear they had performed the surgery. A lawyer who talked to the doctor said he was told the child died before the surgery was performed, she said.
