The Court of Appeal has upheld the election of Bonchari MP John Oroo Oyioka. It dismissed the petition filed by former MP Zebedeo Opore (Jubilee) for lack of merit. Judge Kathurima Mâ€™inoti said: "IEBC conducted free and fair elections on August 8, 2017." Zebedeo moved to the Court of Appeal after the High Court in Kisii dismissed his petition in February, also for lack of merit. Judge Anthony Ndungu had ruled that the election was conducted according to the Constitution. "There were no vote discrepancies, no record was adduced to support such allegations in court to support the petitioner's claims." The court will on Thursday decide the fate of Ugenya MP Chris Karan. His victory was challenged by former MP David Ochieng. Karan challenged the High Court's ruling in March that nullified his election. Click here for the latest political news
