Gor Mahia head coach Dylan Kerr has called for patience with the club’s new boy and Burundian Francis Mustafa, who was signed three weeks ago from Rwandese side, Kiyovu Sports. Mustafa made his SportPesa Premier League debut on Sunday in the ‘Mashemeji Derby’ coming in for an injured Jacquies Tuyisenge and Kerr tipped the lanky striker to find his scoring prowess in the near future. The Kenyan champions turned on Mustafa after losing talisman Meddie Kagere to Tanzanian giants Simba in the June transfer window, where he announced his arrival with two goals in the recently concluded Kagame Cup—netting in the semi finals against Vipers and in the third place playoff against Jeshi La Kujenga Uchumi. Mustafa was lucky to have his name entered for the Caf Confederations Cup, where he came in as a substitute against Yanga, replacing Ephrem Guikan last week and would have bagged a brace from two open scoring chances. In the Nairobi derby, he missed an open chance but Kerr hopes he will gain his scoring form. Speaking after edging bitter rivals AFC leopards 2-1 on Sunday, Kerr also lauded his playing unit for their superb display on the pitch. He said: “Mustafa is new in the Kenyan football and he is still adapting. I am sure he will soon be scoring at will. We have to be patient with him and so should the fans who have alot of expectations from him. I give credit to my players for keeping a winning rhythm and for the win against Leopards.” Goals in either halves from Tuyisenge and George Odhiambo rendered Whyvonne Isuza’s spectacular bicycle kick null and void as K’Ogallo pulled 12 points clear at the top of the at the log with 52 points and three matches in hand.
