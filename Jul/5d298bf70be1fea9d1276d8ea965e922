DP William Ruto has asked the Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs to work with Parliament to amend the regulation that requires women’s groups to have at least 100 members to be funded. He said the change should be changed within two months — a move could incentivise the formation of more women groups. The youth groups only require 25 members to be recognised. Ruto spoke in Kasarani Stadium, where city youth and woemn’s groups got Sh112.5 million cheques. Ruto also urged Parliament to review its decision to slash funds meant for the National Youth Service. He said it was unfortunate that the NYS budget had been reduced at a time when the programme was being expanded to benefit more youths. Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs CS Maragaret Kobia called for the resuscitation of the NYS.  “Let’s not punish the youth for the mistakes of some of us,” she said. In response, the DP the agency is being transformed to curb mismanagement and embezzlement. “I want to persuade MPs not to criminalise and demonise the NYS because of the challenges it has had,” he said. “The NYS can be reformed. It will be reformed and we’ll make it compliant so there is no more corruption.” Also present were Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs CAS Rachel Shebesh and Sport and Culture CS Rashid Echesa. Others were MPs Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi), Mercy Gakuya (Kasarani), Esther Passaris (Nairobi), George Theuri (Embakasi West), Waihenya Ndirangu (Roysambu), Charles Kanyi ( Starehe), Benjamin Gathiru (Embakasi Central) and Kimani Ngunjiri (Bahati).
