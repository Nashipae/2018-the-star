The government has renamed President Uhuru Kenyatta's communication channels to enhance accessibility and flow of information from his office. Twitter handles - @PresidentKE and @PSCU_Digital unit - were affected. Nzioka Waita, who is Chief of Staff and Head of the Presidential Delivery Unit, said State House had reviewed digital media accounts used to convey official information on Uhuru's activities. He said the official Twitter channels are @StateHouseKenya, @UKenyatta, @FirstLadyKenya and @KanzeDena. On Facebook, the official pages are State House Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta and Office of the First Lady Kenya. Waita said the email addresses are pscunews@president.go.ke and spokesperson@president.go.ke and that State House Kenya will be used for YouTube. "All official communication originating from the President’s Strategic Communications Unit will strictly be communicated through the listed channels," he said. "Operational correspondence by PSCU staff to media outlets will be done through officially assigned 'president.go.ke' email addresses." He added that State House will not accept liability or responsibility for any inaccuracies arising from media outlet's reliance on unofficial channels. Click here for the latest political stories
