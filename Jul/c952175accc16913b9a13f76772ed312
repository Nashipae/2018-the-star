Four employees of Family Bank in Ruiru have been arrested in connection with daring break-in and the theft of more than Sh20 million. They are Jane Wanjiru in charge of bank operations, security officer Robert Nduriru, operations supervisor Cyrus Mugo and branch manager Charity Wanjiku. They will be held at Kiambu police station until July 24 to allow for probes. They were arrested on Monday after the loss was discovered. “After opening the bank, security manager John Muchiri discovered the alarm system had been tampered with and the fire alarm had been vandalised,” a police statement said. The robbers are believed to have entered through the roof of the bank’s kitchen on Saturday or Sunday. “They accessed the strong room to the safe by cutting the door using a welding gas cylinder. They accessed the ATM machine using crowbars and the welding gas,” police said. They are pursuing kitchen staff and cleaners. The suspects appeared before senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo. DCIO Paul Wambugu said some witnesses had not recorded statements. He said police plan to  arrest more suspects and seek to recover the cash — Sh20,808,343. Wambugu said they were probing offences of bank burglary and stealing, conspiracy to commit a felony and negligence to prevent a felony. Lawyer Kimani Wakimaa said the suspects were not flight risks and deserved bail. “My clients are entitled to bail or bond. The DCIO has not specifically pointed to any suspect and can’t clearly indicate if any was involved in the heist,” he said.
