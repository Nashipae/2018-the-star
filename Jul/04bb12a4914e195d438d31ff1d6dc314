Lily Mapemba, not her real name, is a career professional, trained and licensed to practise. She has worked for over a decade in Kenyan institutions. It was while she was working in Kiambu, that she met her sweetheart, one Paul (not his real name) a Tanzanian medical professional who was then working in Kenya. They would get married, and were blessed with two children. Paul then moved back home, to Dar es Salaam, prompting Lily to quit her job and join her husband so that the family would settle down. She resigned from her county job, packed up her belongings, and together with her children joined their family head in Dar. Getting a job was difficult because she would need a work permit, and even then, a number of firms turned her down. "I could not get jobs despite having a work permit," she said, in an interview. After three years of trying in vain, she has decided to move back and look for a job in Kenya. She would get one within weeks of settling back in. As the two states signed a raft of measures that
will free up the trade space between the two nations this week, Lily hopes this trend will change, and be more accommodative of Kenyan professionals. Among trade issues that Principal Secretary Trade Chris
Kiptoo and his Tanzanian counterpart Elisante Ole Gabriel agreed on last Wednesday include the
immediate implementation of the report that was conducted by Kenya bureau of
standards and Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority for a week in March. In the new agreement, Kenyan textile products destined for
Tanzania will be treated with preferential treatment. It will also see the recommendations of verification reports
on cement, edible oils and confectionery manufactured in Kenya implemented. The two agreed to work on the electronic tracking of Tanzania's cargo at the Namanga border, and will both visit the border.
