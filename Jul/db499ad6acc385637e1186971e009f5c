Illegal structures along Fedha Road and in Nyayo estate were demolished on Thursday morning, the county saying they were not needed. Most of the 140 structures, which were put up a few months ago, were kiosks and juakali workshops. Nairobi Chief Operations Officer Peter Mbaya said the exercise will be extended to Taj mall area, Embakasi East village, Manyanja Road and Buruburu. Mbaya noted that the city becomes untidy when business people are allowed to set up shot anywhere. "If we allow people to build illegal structures what kind of Nairobi will we have?” he posed. "These people will go back to wherever they came from. Some came from the rural areas.”  /COURTESY  /COURTESY Demolitions took place in Kibera on June 21, but residents who live near the railway line complained, saying they woke up to eviction yet they were to be relocated.
