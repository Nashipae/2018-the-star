Garissa Governor Ali Korane has threatened not to pay Sh53 million awarded to three county executives who were sacked by his predecessor. Mukhtar Bulale (Water) Idris Mukhtar (Trade) and Salah Yakub (Environment) sued the county after their dismissal in 2016. The High Court ruled in their favour but Governor Nathif Jama challenged the ruling. It was upheld by the Court of Appeal. Korane yesterday said he was not aware on what grounds the court decision was based. The governor took issue with the father of one of the former executives, whom he accused of maligning him. “The father came wanting me to pay his son. It is their right anyway. I advised him to go to the county treasury but instead he asked me to sack the officer who was supposed to process the payment,” Korane said. “What business do I have to sack anybody because somebody wants to be paid? In the process he thinks he can form a one-man army to force the governor out of office. I can assure you he will be the loser in the long run because I will not allow it.” Korane spoke at a function in Garissa town attended by Senator Yusuf Haji and Fafi MP Abdikarim Osman, among other leaders. When contacted, the former executive Korane complained about said the governor should pay them. “For your information we don’t have any problem with the governor. It’s the court that ruled that we be paid. That is what we are waiting for, nothing less,” he said.
