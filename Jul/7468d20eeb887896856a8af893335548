The government has been accused of carrying out ‘brutal’ Mau evictions by torching houses, intimidating people and forcing children to sleep in the cold. A section of leaders blamed Narok county commissioner George Natembeya over the evictions from the Mau Forest. Natembeya has said he will issue a statement today at 10am in his office. Bomet Central MP Ronald Tonui and a section of MCAs from Narok accused the county commissioner of “being too harsh and inconsiderate” to people and property. They said evictees, including young children, are sleeping out in the cold after their houses were torched. Tonui said on Saturday, “We will not accept what the security officers did to these people. The government should apologise by rebuilding their houses.” He spoke in Kitoben, Narok South, on Saturday. Melelo MCA Philemon Aruasa (pictured) said, “It is sad security officers torched and demolished houses and Natembeya is all over the media claiming locals voluntarily agreed to move out. The truth is they were forced out and they were threatened.” Aruasa urged Parliament to question Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and his Lands counterpart Farida Karoney over “subjecting the residents to suffering”.
