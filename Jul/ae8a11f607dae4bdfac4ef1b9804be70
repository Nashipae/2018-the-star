Kisumu Girls High School has been closed indefinitely after students went on rampage last night protesting poor diet. The students destroyed the principal's house and vandalised her car. They also stoned the administration block and dining hall breaking window panes. County director of education Sabina Aroni said they have started investigations to get the details on the strike. "For now the students have been told to go home and once investigations are completed and we sit in a meeting we will notify them when to report back," she said at the school.
