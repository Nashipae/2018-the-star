The teachers’ employer is investigating the assault on six non-local tutors at Chalbi Boys’ High School, Marsabit county, on Monday. One of the teachers is in critical condition at Meru Hospital, while the others are admitted at Marsabit General Hospital. The school has been closed indefinitely. Teachers Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia yesterday said the TSC is working with security agencies to establish the motive for the attack. Macharia said the TSC has demanded an explanation from the school management, including a report on the state of security. Three students were held by the police for questioning. “We do not take such issues lightly. It is the responsibility of the TSC to take care of the teachers as their employer. We will establish the cause of the attack and if need be action will be taken,” Macharia said. Cases of attacks on non-local teachers in Northern Kenya are on the increase. But the TSC has rejected calls to end its delocalisation policy, saying it would be a win for the perpetrators. Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion yesterday blamed the TSC for the violence. “We received reports on the attack on teachers through our Marsabit office and we have written to the TSC on the matter,” he said. “This is unacceptable and it is surprising how the TSC keeps turning a deaf ear to the matter and keeps pushing for delocalisation. This is a disaster.” Some teachers in April refused to go back to work in the region and were fired. “We have teachers camping outside the Knut headquarters for three months now after the TSC interdicted them for not honouring their order to go back to North eastern due to similar harassment. But here we are again,” Sossion said. The TSC says the delocalisation of teachers will enhance cohesion and integration.
