Two ODM lawmakers have dismissed demands by Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi to carry out a lifestyle audit “for the dead.”
The MPs — Elisha Odhiambo (Gem) and Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) — said Sudi’s remarks are aimed at undermining the war on corruption and should be rejected.
Sudi had said the audit should begin with founding President Jomo Kenyatta, who died in August 1978. Parameters of the audit have not been spelled out but they are unlikely to go back many years.
Odhiambo said Sudi’s demands show lack of respect for the dead and President Uhuru Kenyatta who called for audits. He urged the President not to allow politicians to seek attention by using the dead.
“Who doesn’t know that the lifestyle audit is for the living who pose a threat to public resources, not the dead who are resting in peace?” Odhiambo said.
The Gem MP asked Uhuru not to allow “such politics to rend the air” in his war against theft of funds.
“I know there is a cold war in Jubilee between those supporting the war on corruption and those scared of the lifestyle audit. That is why some people are behaving suspiciously,” Odhiambo said.
He said the audit is the best tool to fight corruption as some individuals cannot explain how they acquired their wealth.
MP Wandayi said he does not support historical injustices, but there is no way to audit the dead as a way of fighting corruption.
“Where are the dead coming in with the new wave of corruption from NYS, Kenya Power, the NCPB and contraband sugar?” he asked.
Wandayi warned those who have dipped their hands in public coffers not to hide behind their tribes, but to face the consequences alone.
The lawmaker said the lifestyle audit will be carried out in accordance with the law, not in accordance with an indivdual’s wishes.
He said the lifestyle audit is one of the benefits of the handshake and those against it must be culprits one way or the other.
“In three months after the handshake, the war on corruption has taken a new turn,” Wandayi said.
