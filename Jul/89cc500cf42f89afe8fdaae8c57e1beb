The romance between Vera Sidika and Otile Brown has been pronounced dead by online pundits. But is it? The celebrity couple have just come from a vacation together in the very exotic land of Mauritius. One would think this would make their relationship that much stronger. But nah! Both of them have deleted photos of each other on their social media. But Otile Brown denies they have split. “So ho*s have been sending my chick messages telling her that she has failed miserably for falling in love with me, calling me names because I am not a baller. We usually just read them together with Vee and laugh. Even people we know use private accounts just to diss her ‘stupid move’ for falling for me,” he posted. “Someone just texted. This hit me hard, though. She’s saying I am using juju on her. That ‘There is no way, Vee can love an average guy like me’. “First of all, I am not an average dude. I am a true baller on my own level and I aspire to be bigger. Everybody starts from somewhere. “Even if I become a real baller, I would never blow money on no ho*, unless she’s special. So the society got us all fucked up, to a point that a man can’t make a move towards a classy woman and win without blowing cash? Damn! And by the way, I love Vee - and God forbid - if we ever part ways, life has to go on, so don’t dwell on that. Till then, we lit.”
