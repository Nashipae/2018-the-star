A joint Mau Forest security team is clearing settlements in the 922,300-acre Maasai Mau section for rehabilitation. About 3,000 settlers voluntarily left ahead of the expiry of the government notice on Friday last week. On Saturday, officers from the regular and Administration Police, Kenya Forest Service, Kenya Wildlife Service and Narok county rangers descended on Nkoben area, where settlers refused to leave. Some residents complained they were not given adequate time to harvest their crops. They said they bought the land. They did not, however, resist demolitions. Yesterday, Narok county commissioner George Natembeya said the crackdown was moving on smoothly. KFS chairman Peter Kinyua had earlier said the exercise would have a human face. He said it was meant save the forest — the source of many rivers. Narok KFS ecosystem coordinator Mwai Muraguri said, “Most settlers had already left. Those who remained behind until the quit notice expired burnt their houses to blame it on us.” On Sunday, the operation moved to Kosian, where about 2,400 settlers had settled for more than 15 years. Other targeted settlements include Ararwet, Kipchoge, Kaplelach, Kalyasoi, Olmekenyu and Sasumuani — all inside the 24km cutline demarcating Maasai Mau forest and Olpusimoru Forest Reserve. The KFS raised the red flag over wanton destruction when its chairman and acting chief conservator Monica Kalenda visited the water tower three weeks ago. The agency will partner with Narok to rehabilitate it. Kinyua and Kalenda said red cedar had been massively harvested for sale. They called for a total ban on harvesting and transportation of the endangered indigenous tree to save it from depletion. Muraguri said security officers will patrol the forest round the clock to deter future encroachment.
