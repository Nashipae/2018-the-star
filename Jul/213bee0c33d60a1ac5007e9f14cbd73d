Stephen Kirogo, a senior State House official, is currently being vetted for the position of Public Service Commission chair. President Uhuru Kenyatta last week nominated Kirogo for the position that became vacant when Margaret Kobia was appointed Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs CS. He has been serving as the Principal Administrative Secretary in the Cabinet office. Should he be successful, Kirogo will take over from Peter ole Nkuraiyia who has been serving in acting capacity since January. He will hold office for a non-renewable term of six years. On Tuesday, Dr Francis Owino will be vevaluated by the Labour and Social Welfare committee for the position of Principal Secretary for the State Department for Youth. Joyce Mwikali will face the same committee following her nomination as chair of the National Gender and Equality Commission while Priscilla Nyokabi Kinyua and Murithi Chomba will be vetted for membership positions. A showdown looms with the Thursday vetting of former Salaries and Remuneration Commission chair Sarah Serem by the Defence and Foreign Relations committee as Kenya's ambassador to China. Last week, MPs led by Majority Leader Aden Duale said they will have the last laugh in this review. The legislators said Serem had no regard for parliamentarians and placed them at position 48 in ranking. Others to be vetted for ambassadorial and High Commissioner positions are Rtd Lt Samuel Thuita, former DCI boss Ndegwa Muhoro, Paddy Ahenda, Oginga Ogego, Kimani Ondieki, Chris Mburu and Benjamin Langat. On Friday, Esther Koimet will appear before the Transport committee for vetting as Transport and Infrastructure PS.
