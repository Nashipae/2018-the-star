Kiambu Woman representative Gathoni Wamuchomba has said health services in the county have deteriorated and residents must stand up to demand their rights. “The health sector is really wanting. There are loopholes. When we talk about it, we’re told we’re fighting the county government,” she said at Ndumberi Primary School on Wednesday. Wamuchomba donated sanitary pads. She said hospitals lack medicines and the NHIF cards are not helping residents to cover healthcare needs. “It has reached a time when we need to speak out. People should not judge us. It’s the right of the people we represent,” she said. She told the county government to explain the recent death of a woman who was undergoing a caeserian section. It is said her intestines ruptured during the operation at Gatundu South Level-5 Hospital. “The woman’s intestines were tampered with by a doctor and later patched up. She developed internal bleeding that led to her death,” Wamuchomba said. She also told the county to come clean about a burial permit issued for a 20-day-old infant admitted to Kiambu Level-5 Hospital. The child had been declared dead, but it later emerged she was alive. She eventually died after she was referred to another facility.
