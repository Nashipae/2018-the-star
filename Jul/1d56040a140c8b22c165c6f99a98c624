The long-awaited report on the Sh1.9 billion maize purchase scam will be out in a week, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has said. EACC spokesman Yassin Amaro said investigations were in “at the tail end. A report should be out within a week or a short time.” Anti-corruption detectives have already grilled traders and senior staff at the National Cereals and Produce Board allegedly involved in the scam. At least Sh1.9 billion was paid to about 10 traders, while more than 3,500 farmers have yet to be paid Sh5 billion since December. The traders have denied claims of impropriety and said they did genuine business with the board because they ar also farmers. ar Finance CS Henry Rotich said they will be paid Sh1.4 billion by the end of this week. Detectives camped at depots in Kisumu, Bungoma, Kitale, Eldoret (pictured), Moi’s Bridge and Nakuru to investigate. Jackson Mue, EACC deputy director in charge of the North Rift, said, “We want to know if genuine farmers were deliberately denied the opportunity to deliver maize and if there was bribery in the process, among other issues,” he said. Long queues of lorries were witnessed at the NCPB depots as farmers protested that they were being ignored for the benefit of cartels importing maize. The EACC is also seeking to establish if some suppliers were paid more money for their maize than others.
