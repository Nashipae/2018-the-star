Seven Kisumu Girls’ High School students have been charged with malicious damage and creating a disturbance. They denied the charges. They were accused of “willfully and unlawfully” damaging Sh2.9 million school property. It included 10 windows, 33 louvres, 16 doors, nine-kilogramme fire extinguishers and a perimeter wall. In the second count, they are said to have damaged the rear windscreen of their principal’s car. The learners were also charged with “creating a disturbance in a manner likely to breach the peace by shouting and throwing stones at buildings and the neighbourhood”. They appeared before Kisumu chief magistrate Julius Ng’arng’ar. They were granted Sh50,000 bond or Sh30,000 bail each. The hearing was set for August 7. The school was closed indefinitely on July 2, after students went on a rampage. Police officers were called in to restore calm. They also rescued principal Margaret Mamai who was under siege. Education CS Amina Mohamed and Knec chairman George Magoha visited the school and issued a stern warning against unrest.
