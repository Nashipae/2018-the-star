Kenya Power has sunk -28.02% Year to data second only to ARM which is -65.76% Year to date. Jesse Livermore aka Edwin Lefevre said "Markets are never wrong, only opinions are." I came across Noordin Haji at the Swiss Ambassador's residence last week on the occasion of the visit of the Swiss President Alain Berset to Kenya whom I interviewed see herehttp://bit.ly/2N4gzb6 I said to the DPP ''Look at that i was thinking about you and voila here you are'' By the way thats called serendipity, which is one of my favourite words and well worth looking up when you have a moment. Anyway, as i stood in front of the DPP, for some reason my mind flipped to Paul Ekman and his totemic book ''What the Face reveals'' Its an extraordinary book which gives the Reader a Road-Map to read micro-expressions. Micro-expressions are split-second facial movements which are essentially not controllable. I nearly got divorced when i read Ekman because I kept saying to the Missus ''But Darling you don't mean that.'' I found myself looking a bit too intently at the DPP thinking to myself, a Fellow who operated deep under cover, in the shadows, lets see if i can read his micro-expressions. That was early last week. Then at the end of the week, the Office of the DPP in a series of machine-gun tweets said this; I have directed the DCI to immediately cause the arrest of the following persons and have them arraigned in court to answer charges 1.Dr. Ben Chumo – Former MD & CEO KPLC [When sought for comment, Chumo asked to be called back later- Reuters] 2.Dr. Ken Tarus – GM, Finance (as he then was) [Tarus’s phone was off and he was not immediately available to comment - Reuters] 3.Beatrice Meso – GM, Corporate Affairs & Company Secretary 4.Peter Mungai Kinuthia- GM, Business Strategy amongst others 48)I am therefore satisfied there is a prosecutable case made out against each and every one of the following persons jointly/severally 53) •Conspiracy to commit an offence of economic crime •Wilful failure to comply with the law relating to management of public funds I have to give credit where credit is due and it is due to the Blogosphere which had been relentless. KPLC of course drew everyones attention because of the extraordinary Taleb like Fat Tail volatility in our bills. Interestingly, KPLC had received outstanding multi-lateral support particularly for its last Mile Effort. You will need to ask the likes of the World Bank exactly what kind of due diligence they have been doing because clearly it was very superficial. Kenya Power owns and operates most of the electricity transmission and distribution system in the country and sells electricity to over 6.675,534 million customers (as at May 06, 2018). So what happens next? The ODDP's charge sheet is compelling. We will need a real quick forensic analysis to get our arms around the size of the Hole. Someone serious has to be parachuted in real quick. More ''plus Ã§a change, plus c'est la meme chose'' is not going to cut it. In fact, The Signal in the Noise is that this Model has run out of road, in fact, its careered off the road. Look outside and you will see the debris everywhere from Mumias Sugar to Uchumi to Nakumatt etc etc. Abraaj's Founder [Abraaj was one of Africa's biggest Buy-Out Funds and of course owns Java here in Kenya and is facing its own denouement] Arif Naqvi famously said ''Todays Peacock is tomorrow's Feather Duster'' KPLC was a bit of peacock. Avoiding the Fate of being a Feather Duster is going to require a significant mind-set and personnel change. Lets see how the share price performs Monday.
