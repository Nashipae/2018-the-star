 Relegation-threatened Western Jaguars will hope to record their first win of the 2018 Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League season when they host two teams in their Kakamega backyard this weekend. They welcome Nakuru Hockey Club today before facing defending champions and current table-toppers, Kenya Police tomorrow. Michael Malungu’s side are yet to win a match in the eight matches played so far and sit the bottom of the log with just three points. Despite enjoying the home advantage Jaguars will be unfortunate to miss their head coach who is in charge of the Kenyan hockey team for the youth games in Algeria. Today’s opponents are also staring at the axe as they sit 10th with eight points just a spot high from the red zone. Should Jaguars miraculously scoop the six points on offer, they will scale two places higher. As Jaguars will be seeking to unhook themselves from the jaws of relegation, Police will approach the match with their guns fully cocked to extend their stay at the top of the standings as well as revenge last season’s painful 1-0 loss which ended their unbeaten run. Patrick Mugambi’s charges have amassed 27 points from ten matches three ahead of second placed Butali Warriors who have a match in hand. Last season’s runners up Butali Warriors headline the three matches set for tomorrow at City Park when they confront Wazalendo. Butali are behind Police and will seek to win their match, hoping that Police fall in Kakamega to level the points tally. 2016 champions Strathmore University Gladiators play fellow students USIU-A Mashujaa while Sliders take on USIU-A Spartans in the ladies tie.
