The family of deceased Migori Senator Ben Okello on Monday urged ODM leader Raila Odinga to give his eldest son, Willis, a direct ticket to vie for the seat. Paul Ang’ila said they will support Okello’s son for the seat, saying “the seat belongs to the Okellos and anybody who wants to vie should wait until 2022”. Willis said, “Migori people gave my father a five-year contract, he had a vision to achieve, which I’m ready to finish.” Senators James Orengo of Siaya, Irungu Kang’ata (Murang’a) and Mutula Kilonzo Jnr (Makueni) urged Raila to consider the plea. “The Senate is yet to declare Migori seat vacant for a reason as we are sorting his family matters. I will move to court to stop the process until the family is taken care of,” Orengo said.
