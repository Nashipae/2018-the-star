Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has urged the national government to withdraw all suspected contraband sugar in the market. Karua said unless the sugar is withdrawn, Kenyans should boycott all sugar products. She spoke in Mombasa yesterday during the opening of the 2nd Lady Accountant Annual Conference at Whitesands Hotel. Karua asked the government to clear the airon contaminated sugar. “We were talking about contraband sugar, which we were told has lead and copper, but we were never told where the sugar has gone to,” she said. Karua said CSs Sicily Kariuki (Health), Fred Matiang’i (Interior) and Adan Mohammed (Trade) owe Kenyans a statement on what happened to the said sugar. “We should ask this question loudly. Where is the contraband sugar? Has it been withdrawn from the market or the government is waiting for us to be poisoned?” she said. Karua said she has boycotted sugar until the government explains what happened to the stock. She said the government is killing the sugar industry by not explaining where the contaminated sugar is. On corruption, Karua said the Council of Governors made a mistake by asking for immunity for governors. She said only the President, who is the symbol of national unity, deserves immunity. “For the Council of Governor to call for immunity is outrageous. Unless they are suggesting they have done something wrong, they have no reason to be worried. Every person must be held accountable.” Karua supported calls for a lifestyle audit of all public officers. She said reports that there is no legal framework for the audit is erroneous. “The Public Officer Ethic Act, obliges all state officer to declare their wealth annually.” Lifestyle audits are used to determine if an employee’s lifestyle is commensurate with known income. The employer has detailed knowledge of remuneration but limited knowledge of their lifestyle. Read : Relax, this sugar will not kill you - experts Click here for the latest political news
