Circumcision of boys of between 10 and 15 will commence on Wednesday next week in Trans Nzoia county. The county holds the circumcision ceremony every two years. More than 3,000 boys are expected to be circumcised this year from the Bukusu, Tachoni, Banyala and Kabras communities. If all the families go the traditional way, it is estimated they will spend Sh60 million, as the ceremony costs at least Sh20,000. Peter Masinde, a Bukusu cultural elder, said 100 traditional circumcisers will convene in Kiminini on Saturday to finalise the preparations in a small ritual ceremony to sanctify the knives. “Two white cocks will be slaughtered and eaten by the circumcisers. Busaa [traditional liquor] will be spread on the knives to cleanse them before we start the operation next Wednesday,” he said. The knife is known as ‘lukembe’ and the circumcision is referred to as ‘Embalu. The county culture department estimates that half of the boys will be circumcised in hospital. The circumcisers have been trained in proper hygiene.
