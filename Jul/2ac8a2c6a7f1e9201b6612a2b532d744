Efforts by former CS Michael Kamau to stop his trial over the alleged misappropriation of Sh33 million hit a snag yesterday. The court refused to grant his request. The former Roads CS was charged and ordered to pay Sh500,000 bail to secure his freedom. He has denied abuse of office and failure to comply with guidelines on public funds management while he served as a PS in the same ministry between July 2007 and March 2008. He was accused of authorising the redesign of Kamukuywa-Kaptama-Kapsokwony-Sirisia Road. Read: Former CS Kamau loses bid to terminate corruption case Click here for
