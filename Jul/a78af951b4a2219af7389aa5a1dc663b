Communication within Parliament will go digital by mid-next month after tablets are installed, National Assembly speaker Justin Muturi said yesterday. He told MPs that 350 tablets have been delivered and 109 have been installed with customised applications. “I wish to request your patience as the clerk and his team complete the exercise. The gadgets will be user-friendly,” he said. “The contractor has undertaken to work overtime to ensure he instals 30 tablets every day after the rise of the House and hopes to complete the project by August 16.” He said the gadgets will be installed in the National Assembly and the Senate to ease operations. MPs will use the tablets to receive order papers, votes and proceedings, committee schedules, the Constitution and statues, bills, Acts and committee reports, among other documents. “I’m certain you will embrace this slight technological interruption,” Muturi said. The introduction of the gadgets, a first in Parliamentary, will reduce the cost of operations and save the environment, Muturi said. Click here for the latest political news
