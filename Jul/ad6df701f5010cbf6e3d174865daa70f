Change of school management in the middle of the year is to blame for rising cases of school fires, a unionist has said. Kenya National Union of Teachers Marakwet branch secretary John Cheberi said students could be torching schools to protest against transfer of new teachers to their schools. His remarks come amid reports that structures, mainly dormitories, in at least 47 schools across the country have been burnt down. “New school principals come with new management styles and this is causing jitters among teachers and students,” Cheberi said. Cheberi asked the Teachers Service Commission to stop massive transfer of school heads under its delocalization policy, saying this will end unrest in secondary schools.
