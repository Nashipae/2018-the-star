The Nyeri government has banned the sale of clay soil used in Mukurweini to make ceramics. The administration said residents are exploited by unscrupulous buyers. They pay as low as Sh4,000 per truck but sell it for Sh40,000 to a factory in Isinya, Kajiado county, Governor Mutahi Kahiga said yesterday. Kahiga met MP Anthony Kiai, Rugi MCA Cyrus Ngure, Water and Environment executive Fredrick Kinyua and county secretary Ben Gachichio. They said they will put measures in place to protect residents. “I urge you to be patient. The exercise will resume,” Kahiga said. The four plan to meet traders, landowners and other leaders. He said they will build a training centre where residents will learn how to produce ceramics and benefit more from their resources.
