Health services in Nyamira have been disrupted for two weeks following a workers’ strike. The health workers went on strike to demand May and June salaries. Kenya Nutional Union of Nurses Nyamira secretary Richard Oruta said the services will remain paralysed until the county government pays the salary arrears. “We cannot work without pay. Our salaries are delayed yet we are told to go back to work,” he said. Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union Nyanza secretary Lameck Omweri said the county government should intervene and ensure services resume. He said the health workers will remain on strike until they receive their salaries. “We do not care whether patients are suffering. All we need is payment to resume work. All our members have been advised to stay away from their stations.” Nyamira Deputy Governor Amos Nyaribo said the delay of payment is affecting Nyamira workers. He said the county has made arrangements and the workers will be paid soon. “Our health workers need to know they are not the only group that has been affected by the delay of payments. All other workers in the county have not been paid. They should bear with us,” Nyaribo said. Efforts to reach Nyamira Health executive Douglas Bosire were fruitless. Nyamira Senator Okong’o Omogeni on Tuesday asked the striking nurses to go back to work. “It is not fair to subject our health workers to delayed salaries. Something must be done soon to ensure the health staff are taken care of,” he said. Last week, the deputy governor promised the payments will be processed by Thursday, but it never came to pass. He said the pay delay was caused by a deal reached by nurses and the Council of Governors in the middle of the financial year.
