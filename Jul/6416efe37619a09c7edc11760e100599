The Kenya Bureau of Standards has told a parliamentary committee that only four companies were allowed to import raw sugar following a gazette notice by Treasury CS Henry Rotich. Appearing before the joint committee on Trade and Agriculture on Tuesday, acting MD Moses Ikiara said the rest of the companies were only licensed to import table sugar for domestic consumption. "I confirm to this committee that only four companies - Sukari industries, West Kenya, Menengai Oil Limited and Amnav Limited - were issued with Certificates of Conformity to import raw sugar," Ikiara said. As to whether the other companies observed the instruction to only import sugar for domestic use, Ikiara said that cannot be ascertained as what is consumed locally must tested in a laboratory.

"We have four types of sugar. The first one is the refined white sugar which is meant for industrial processing only but  is not harmful to consumers," he explained. "The second one is plantation mill white sugar, which is used in domestic setups while the third is brown sugar for hospitality purposes and the fourth raw sugar which is unprocessed." Ikiara told MPs that the raw and unprocessed sugar cannot be consumed directly. "Raw sugar is not supposed to be exposed to the public. [If it is, a crime is committed]. It is also worth noting that members of the public cannot distinguish between raw and processed sugar. This can only be demonstrated through analysis after a test report." The MD maintained that Kebs does not clear sugar that is not parked to leave the port of entry.
