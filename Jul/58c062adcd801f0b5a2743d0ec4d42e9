Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has said tarmacking of the stalled Nguni-Nuu Road will resume immediately. He spoke on Tuesday when he inspected Nuu Road accompanied by engineers. He said the construction work partially disrupts transport, especially during rainy seasons. The project was launched in July last year by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mulyungi said he will ensure the Enziu River Bridge is included in the road construction contract to stop deaths in the river. "I will not rest until Enziu Bridge is completed,"he said.
