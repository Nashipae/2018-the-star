Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter will know about his fate tomorrow when the Court of Appeal rules on his election that was nullified. His lawyers led by Otiende Omollo told the appeal judges in Eldoret that High Court judge Kanyi Kimondo erred in law by nullifying the election based on evidence that was not factual. “The High Court used one ground that Keter campaigned in six places, but we have argued that there was no evidence to that effect,” said Otiende while giving his submission before three appeal judges led by Erastus Githinji. The jubilee MP challenged the decision by Justice Kanyi Kimondo to revoke his election on March 1.
