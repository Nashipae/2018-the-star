No one has been arrested three days after a matatu and 10 motorcycles were burnt by two rival groups. Kisumu Central police boss Meshack Kiptum yesterday said they are still investigating. The two groups fought after a matatu allegedly hit a boda boda on Kakamega highway on Friday. The riders torched the vehicle the same day. The matatu operators retaliated by torching motorcycles in Kibuye and Kondele area on Saturday. Kisumu Central deputy county commissioner Tom Machenere said leaders of the two groups must control their followers. “We have talked to both sides and told the officials to control their colleagues and members because as officers we will not tolerate such,” he said yesterday. Machenere said anybody found to have incited the rioters will be charged. Motorists told the Star they could not risk operating in Kibuye and Kondele areas anymore. “What we have witnessed in Kondele area ... I can’t risk going back there ... it doesn’t matter how much a customer offers. I can’t,” a matatu driver said. Nelson Odire, chairman of the Kisumu County Boda Boda Riders Cooperative Union, said he had tried in vain to calm the riders. “It’s high time we got rid of rowdy people because only a few take actions that affect the entire sector and businesses in the town,” Odire said. He urged the matatu and boda boda operators to always consult and not retaliate. “We want peace so we will ensure this does not happen again,” he said. Residents said this is not the first time boda boda riders have torched a vehicle. “Accidents do happen. Why can’t they stop taking law into their hands and report the matters to the police instead of burning a Nissan, look what this has cost,” said Mary Akoth, at Kibuye Market.
