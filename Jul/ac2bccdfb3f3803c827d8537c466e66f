A legislator in Kiambu county has asked residents to avoid politicising national government projects. Lari MP Jonah Mburu asked residents to avoid criticising Jubilee projects, saying they are meant to benefit and improve residents’ lives. He said some residents threatened to protest, saying the Uplands Githunguri Ruiru Road is being constructed by an unknown contractor. Mburu said the China Gansu International Corporation Company, which was awarded the project by Kenya National Highway Authority, is still the contractor. “Those inciting people to protest must be informed that nothing has changed regarding the contractor.” Mburu spoke at the Uplands chief’s office, where he met China Gansu resident engineer Njoki Mungai and maintenance engineer Joseph Theuri. The MP said the tarmacking commissioned by Deputy President William Ruto at Kwamaiko on June 22 is expected to be completed in 18 months. Theuri asked residents to be patient about getting casual jobs. “We start with maintenance, which is mostly done using machines. There are very few jobs, but once we start the actual construction, a lot of casual jobs will be available,” he said.
