Fresh from bagging the Prinsloo Sevens crown over the weekend, Homeboyz will renew their rivalry with Menengai Oilers, Mean Machine and Masinde Muliro University for this week’s Sepetuka tournament in Eldoret. Paul Murunga’s charges were clinical in beating Mwamba 19-12 in the final in the Rift Valley on Sunday and the coach is satisfied with the performance. “It’s always tough especially in the first tournament because you don’t know where your competitors are in terms of fitness and tactics. However, the boys played well and we hope to carry the momentum to the Sepetuka Sevens,” added Murunga. The deejays skipper and former Kenya Sevens international Bush Mwale expects the circuit to get much tougher in the weeks ahead. “Everyone is upping their game so we can’t rest on our laurels and expect everything to be easy. We must be at our best throughout to win the overall series,” added Mwale. Mwamba are seeded in Pool ‘B’ against defending series champions Kabras, Strathmore Leos and Kisumu RFC. Head coach Kevin Wambua said his ride to the final surprised many and expects the side to get better as the series progresses. “We will definitely get better! This is very young team who are fearless and from what we saw in Nakuru over the weekend, no team can underrate us,” he added. Impala Saracens headline Pool C and face Nakuru RFC, Catholic Monks and Blak Blad. KCB are the frontrunners in Pool ‘D’ and have date with Quins, Nondies and Resolution Kisii. The top two teams advance to the Main Cup quarter-finals with third and fourth placed teams heading to the Challenge Trophy category. After Sepetuka Sevens, the series will take a three- week break to pave way for the Rugby World Cup qualifier pitting Kenya and Tunisia on Aug 11at the RFUEA ground. The series resumes on August 18-19 with the Kabeberi Sevens in Machakos. Other legs of the series are Driftwood (August 25-26) in Mombasa, Dala Sevens (September 8-9) and Christie (September 15-16).
