All sugar imported into the country during the duty-free window was not licensed, MPs heard yesterday. Agriculture and Food Authority interim director Solomon Odera told MPs the AFA was kept in the dark during the importation, despite their regulatory role. The body is mandated to license sugar importers and exporters. It is the only agency that should advise on the quantity and quality of sugar to be brought.

It waivered all restrictions on importers. Odera said some blacklisted companies with criminal records took advantage of the blanket waiver to import sugar. “The May 12 Gazette notice was published without indications of quantity, quality and who should be allowed to import,” he said. However, the Kenya Revenue Authority appeared before the joint committtee on Trade and Agriculture this week. It clarified that apart from the duties, all other requirements were to be met by the importers. Odera told the Committe on Implementation of the National Assembly that up to 10 companies involved in importation of contraband sugar were unlicensed. It is chaired by Narok North MP Moitalel ole Kenta.  He said the AFA had not renewed licences of Hydrer P Ltd, Krish Commodities Ltd, Reeswood Enterprises, Shake Distributors, Kenafric Industries, Czarnikow EA Ltd, Stuntwave Ltd, Mshale Commodities Ltd (Kenya), Rising Star Commodities and Shree Sai Industries Ltd following recommendation by Parliament in 2015. Odera appeared before the committee to give updates on the implementation status of the report on inquiry into the crisis facing the sugar industry.
