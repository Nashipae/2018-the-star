A former Garissa county referral hospital CEO Ahmed Dagane has appealed to the county government to pay his dues worth millions of shillings. Dagane served as the CEO during Governor Nathif Jama’s tenure. He sought help at the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Nairobi in March. His salary was stopped in November last year. Addressing the press in Garissa town yesterday, Dagane said his salary was stopped after a reshuffle in which he was moved to the County Affairs department as a senior director. Judge Hellen Wasilwa last week summoned the officials responsible for the payment to explain why the court orders were not enforced. The court first issued orders on March 21, ordering the county to pay Dagane the Sh2 million. The officials include Abdi Ali (county secretary), Mohamed Sheikh (county service board secretary), Ibrahim Malow (Finance chief officer) and Yussuf Abdullahi (the pay roll manager). “My efforts to try and have my issue addressed amicably has been met with a lot of frustrations,” Dagane said. “I want to be told what my fate is. The situation is taking a toll on me socially, psychology and physically.” County secretary Ali said he is yet to receive the summons.
