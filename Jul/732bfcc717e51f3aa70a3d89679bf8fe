Eight ODM legislators from Migori have backed the party's decision to hand former minister Ochillo Ayacko a direct ticket for the county's October 8
Senate by-election. The lot led by Suna East MP Junet
Mohamed (ODM director of elections) said they are satisfied with Ayacko flying the party's ticket in his bid
to replace the late Senator Ben Okelo. "We
are satisfied that Ayacko’s nomination as candidate fall within the
provisions of the ODM Constitution. We appeal to our supporters and all
residents to fall in line and support Ayacko," they said in a statement on Monday. They are Tom Odege (Nyatike), Paul Abuor (Rongo), Mark Nyamita (Uriri), Peter
Masara (Suna West), Walter Owino (Awendo), Pamela Odhiambo (Woman Rep), and
nominated MP Denittah Ghati. The legislators promised to give all necessary support for Ayacko to clinch the seat against
his rivals. The remarks followed after Migori
Governor Okoth Obado publicly announced his support for Dalmas Otieno. The
governor argued that the National Election Board does not represent the
residents' choice. Ayacko’s
candidature was arrived at by ODM’s NEC in association with the party's top brass. "We urge all ODM supporters in Migori to remain calm, united
and maintain peace now and into the future. We are always stronger together," the legislators said. Click here for the latest political news
