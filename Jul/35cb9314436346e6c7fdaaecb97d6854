Kenya will double its shareholding in Africa50, an infrastructure investment platform to Sh10 billion ($100 million), President Uhuru Kenyatta announced yesterday. The country, initially with a share capital of about Sh5 billion, is among the founder investors in the venture fund supported by the African Development Bank (AfDB). Uhuru said, Kenya’s increase in shareholding, is a vote confidence in the fund’s work in the country and the region. He spoke during the third shareholders meeting in Nairobi, which was the first in East Africa. “Infrastructure development is crucial because none of the Big Four will be achieved without proper infrastructure. It is a key enabler for development,” said Uhuru. According to Africa50, the continent needs at least Sh10.8 trillion per annum to complete infrastructure projects by 2025. This, it said, could be achieved by unlocking of project value through equity investments and value-add capabilities. The agency said most investors avoid Africa due to the perception that the continent is a high-risk destination, characterised by slow progress and an environment considered to be disabling to Public Private Partnerships. The agency is looking to invest in infrastructure, power generation and transmission among others. It has a committed capital of Sh82.5 billion from its 25 member countries, the African Development Bank, Central Bank of West African States, and Bano Al-Maghrib.
