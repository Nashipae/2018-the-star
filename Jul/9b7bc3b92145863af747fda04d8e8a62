A proposed Sh1 billion sanitary landfill will not pollute underground water in Murang’a, a court was told on Tuesday.
Nairobi Metropolitan Improvement Project (Namsip) engineer Benjamin Njenga told Justice Grace Kemei it would have a concrete design and nonpermeable lining to prevent seepage.
Only non-toxic waste will be deposited, after 10 years the landfill will be converted to a park.
In an affidavit, Njenga told the Environment and Land Court in Murang’a that the landfill would not disrupt residents’ lives. It is proposed for Mitubiri, Maragua.
Resident Benmark Ng’ang’a wants the project stopped. He filed a petition on May 7 and asked the court to compel Namsip to find an alternative site for the landfill. Some residents fear it will pollute the environment and cause health problems.
The respondents are the Attorney General, Cabinet secretaries James Macharia (Transport), Keriako Tobiko (Environment), Simon Chelugui (Water) and National Environment Management Authority (Nema).
Njenga said only Murang’a would use the landfill for non-toxic solid waste,  not five counties. The Nairobi metropolitan area includes Machakos, Kajiado, Kiambu and Murang’a.
An environmental impact assessment report has been given to Nema for approval, he said.
The waste management project is funded by the World Bank, it includes three boreholes on 50 acres where water quality would be tested monthly.
Njenga told the court a feasibility study done by Namsip in 2016 found Mitubiri a suitable site.
Namsip has held public participation forums in the area that has a population of 32,365. Residents were informed about the project and they gave their views, he said.
In May, Namsip took MCAs from Murang’a to Arusha in Tanzania to learn about sanitary landfills. MPs will be taken to South Africa for a similar study. The judge will issue directions on September 17.
