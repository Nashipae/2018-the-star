Kenya Power has advised customers on prepaid service to buy tokens early as the system will be shut down on Tuesday night for routine maintenance. The firm said the service will be unavailable for 12 hours between Tuesday 10 pm and Wednesday 10 am to enable engineers work on the prepaid IT system. “During this period, all prepaid services which include buying tokens through paybill 888880 will not be available,” the company said in a statement on Sunday. “Other prepaid tokens buying outlets such as our banking halls and vendor outlets will also be affected,” it added. Consumers on the postpaid billing system will, however, not be affected and will continue making payments via 888888 or in banking halls. The prepaid system has over the recent past experienced hitches where customers complained that it was taking too long for token orders to go through. A section of customers also raised concerns over the varying amount of units they receive even when they buy tokens with the same amount of money.
