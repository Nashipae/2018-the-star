The incident took place at a farm about a kilometre away from the institution. "A plainclothed policeman chased Njoroge and shot him in the head in a banana plantation. It's like he targeted Njoroge as he was with his colleagues who were not shot," a learner said at the scene. Before he was killed, Njoroge had said, “We’re here to continue our push for justice. We ask the ministry to look into the fee issue. While other universities pay Sh33,000 per year, we must pay more than Sh50,000.” Click here for the latest political news
