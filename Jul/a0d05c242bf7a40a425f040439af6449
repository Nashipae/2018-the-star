World U18 2,000 steeplechase champion Leonard Bett will hope to keep Kenya’s rich tradition in the 3,000m steeplecahse when he parades for the qualifying rounds today. Team Kenya have dominated the water and barrier event since inception of the junior event with the likes of World and Olympic champion Consenslus Kipruto, Jonathan Muia, Baranbas Kipyego and Amos Kirui in recent years and Bett to extend that feat. Bett will be under pressure to deliver but first, he must qualify for the final with the first five in each heat qualifying and the five fastest losers booking their spots in the final. Top athletes to watch out in the event include Albert Chemutai of Uganda, Tekele Nigate and Getnet Wale of Ethiopia, Mohammed Rachidi of Morocco and Ousama Basi of Algeria.
