The Court of Appeal has dismissed the petition against Mbere South MP Geoffrey King'ang'i's election. While rejecting the case on Tuesday, the court noted that claims of bribery and witchcraft went unproven. During the hearing of the petition, a witness alleged that King’ang’i hired witch doctors to give voters raw meat as part of a ritual that would see him elected. Kevin Murimi, a witness for petitioner Kamau Nyutu, said the MP used two witch doctors to administer the ritual on July 22. Murimi claimed he participated in the slaughtering of a bull the previous night and that some of the meat was cooked. He said the voters were also given Sh500 each. King'ang'i dismissed the "pure lies" and said his rival was only out to taint his reputation.
