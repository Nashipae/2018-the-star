Nyandarua county on Monday launched the County Integrated Development Plan 2 for 2018-22. The document is aligned to the Jubilee manifesto, Vision 2030, the medium term plan, Sustainable Development Goals and other policy documents. Governor Francis Kimemia launched the plan at Ol Kalou Stadium. He said the document is grounded on President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s Big Four agenda. Kimemia said his government aims to fast-track development through value addition initiatives. They include agroprocessing, building industrial parks, affordable finance and promotion of small and medium businesses for youth and women. Kimemia said the Nyandarua public service will adopt a servant culture to ensure services are provided promptly. He said the county has huge untapped potential which constitutes a vibrant young labour force, fertile agriculture land and an ideal location for tourism.
