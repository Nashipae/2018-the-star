Businessman Francis Mburu recorded statements at the DCI headquarters on Wednesday afternoon, alongside a man who attempted to defraud him by impersonating a DCI officer. Flying Squad officers arrested Mburu and the suspect at his Kileleshwa home early on Wednesday. The officers recovered a pistol and an ID stating the man works for the National Intelligence Service. Police said the man is a fake NIS officer who attempted to get money from Mburu by pretending he could help him solve his problems. Mburu is the MD of companies that own the Sh3 billion 13.7-acre property occupied by Ruaraka High and Drive Inn Primary schools. He and his sons were arrested by EACC officers on July 20 amid the controversial Ruaraka land probe. He was released after questioning and defended himself against allegations that he irregularly received billions of shillings in the land sale.
