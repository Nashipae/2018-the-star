A crocodile killed a 15-year-old boy at River Athi in Kibwezi Sub-county on Sunday. Victim Mutuku Kioko, of Kathiaka village, had taken cattle to drink water when he was attacked, Assistant County Commissioner Kibwezi Vitalis Ogur said. Kioko was a class seven pupil of Kanyungu Primary School. His Uncle George Kyombo said the reptile returned to the water after other children started screaming. "When I arrived I found his body on the sand near the water," Kyombo said, adding they had complained about crocodiles but that no action had been taken. Village elder King'oo Mwanzwii said attacks were rampant. He gave the example of a woman who was attacked while fetching water but was rescued by residents. Mwanzwii said they had also lost livestock to the reptiles and farm produce to hippos that invade their farms. "We appeal to Kenya Wildlife Service to make the area safe," he said. Police took the body to Makindu Sub-county hospital mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
