Two killers of a former Saboti CDF manager yesterday escaped a death sentence. Kenneth Barasa and Nahashon Omondi were jailed for 20 years each for killing. However, Barasa will only serve 13 years because he has already spent seven years in remand, while Omondi will remain behind bars for 15 years because he spent five in remand. They killed Joshua Orina on March 19, 2008, at Nzoia Sugar Company’s nuclear plantation block 513 in Bungoma East. Justice Hillary Chemitei said the prosecution proved that the two were involved in the killing. “After consideration from both parties, the court will not sentence the two for murder but they will have to serve 20 years in prison each”, he said in Kitale. Orina’s family protested that the sentence was too leninent noting that Orina left behind a widow and a young child. Charles, the deceased’s brother, said the family would decide whether to file an appeal. The prosecution called 13 witnesses during the ten-year trial. The two killers and former Saboti CDF treasurer Isaac Masengeli, who is still at large, abducted Orina before killing him. Orina’s widow Jemima Nyamusi said her husband left her at a supermarket in Kitale town to deliver a letter to Masengeli within the town but never returned. The letter was from the CDF regional auditor questioning unsurrendered imprest amounting to Sh700, 000. After abducting Orina, the killers forced him to withdraw up to Sh72,000 from his bank account. Police used images extracted from an Equity Bank ATM CCTV to arrest Omondi and Barasa. Masengeli’s vehicle, which carried Orina from Kitale to the murder scene in Bungoma, had cracked windscreens, which the court was told resulted from the struggle between Orina and his abductors.
