The Judiciary is on the spot over expenditure of Sh1.3 billion on 27 construction projects countrywide. According to Auditor General Edward Ouko’s report for financial year 2016-17, the Judiciary had 55 construction projects valued at Sh6.6 billion. This comprised 28 projects funded by the World Bank at Sh5.3 billion, while 27 were funded by the government at Sh1.3 billion. Ouko noted that during the financial year the Judiciary budgeted Sh962.4 million for the projects but instead spent Sh231.5 million. “An audit of a sample of six of the construction projects revealed that all the sampled projects had stalled despite payments made to the respective contractors...,” the report stated.

Maraga told the media last Tuesday that there are fears 70 projects would stall. This is because the World Bank funding, under which 29 of the projects fall, expires in December. Maraga said 41 government-funded projects, including the construction of Marsabit, Amagoro, Githogo and Hamisi courts, were underway. Ouko’s report shows construction works sampled at Hamisi, Siaya, Nakuru, Eldama Ravine, Eldoret and Narok law courts had stalled.

But verification by the auditor showed Sh273.4 had been paid on the project which was 65 per cent complete. The World Bank project took effect in April 2013 and is scheduled to end in December, unless an agreement is reached to extend it. “The repercussions of this are unimaginable, with a flood of incomplete projects across the country,” Maraga said. The Judiciary had requested for Sh31.02 billion from the government to support its operations for this financial year – 2018-19. The budgetary requirement was broken down to a recurrent Sh19.8 billion, Sh11.4 billion for the development and Sh891 million as the JSC resource requirement.
