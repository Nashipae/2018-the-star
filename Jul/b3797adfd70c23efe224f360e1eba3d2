Bungoma MCAs have asked Governor Wycliffe Wangamati to sack health executive Antony Walela for failure to end corruption in the supply of drugs. The MCAs on Friday threatened to impeach Walela for incompetence. Deputy speaker Wamusai Simiyu said there were no drugs in hospitals because of graft. He accused Walela of sleeping on the job. Walela has accused the assembly of witch-hunt. “He is unable to deliver. This house approved his nomination and has the authority to tell him to vacate office because of lapses in his docket,” Simiyu said. Health committee chairman George Makari (Musikoma), Jack Kawa (Bokoli), Elvis Abuka (Milima) and Barasa Mukhongo proposed that Walela be summoned to explain what they are doing to end theft of drugs. “The only rescue is for this house to summon him so that we can impeach him because he is completely weak,” Makari said. Kawa said the assembly could not be accused of witch-hunt when it was doing its work. “Let Walela be impeached for failing the docket,” Kawa said. Mukhongo said Walela’s work had not been felt. Speaker Emmanuel Situma approved the motion before members adopted it. READY “The fact-finding mission by the health committee on challenges facing the docket has been moved and seconded and the recommendations adopted,” Situma said. Walela defended himself, saying he cannot be compromised. “MCAs should give us time to work. If they want to impeach me, then I’m ready. I have done my work and it is being felt on the ground,” Walela said. Click here for
