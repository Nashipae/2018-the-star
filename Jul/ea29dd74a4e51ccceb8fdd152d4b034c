Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto says the AG's office is seriously underfunded causing an acute shortage of staff and other needs. Ogeto says they had requested parliament to allocate them Sh11.5 billion but only Sh5.5 billion was allocated. He says the government will be forced to pay claims running into billions of shillings awarded by courts especially in cases where the state is not represented due to the shortage of state counsels. “We will soon be engaging parliament so that we can be allocated funds to carry out the expansion plans we have”, said Ogeto who spoke in Eldoret. He said the AG's office plans to devolve its operations by opening offices in all the 47 counties within the next two years. Ogetto said currently they are located in only ten counties making it difficult to serve the government and Kenyans. “In a region like North Rift with eight counties we have only three state counsels serving eight counties and dealing with more than 3,000 cases," said Ogetto. He said such a region requires more than 15 state councils. All other regional offices face similar challenges. Ogeto said the state councils in the counties are usually forced to travel via matatu while carrying important files because they do not have adequate vehicles. Ogeto, however, cautioned government officers to always act as per the law and the constitution so that the government does not spend a lot in paying costs of cases in courts. “We will go out to sensitize government officers on the need to always operate within the law to avoid costly legal disputes against the state”, said Ogeto.
