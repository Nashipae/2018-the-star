Masai Technical Training Institute in Kajiado County was closed on Tuesday after students went on a rampage over food. It was said that a fight broke out on Monday after some students poured food saying it was unfit for human consumption. A student who recorded a video of the events was assaulted. Learners who spoke to the Star on Tuesday said tension spilled over from the night and that county Education executive Samuel Kanar was forced to intervene. Kanar said: “It is a small issue that the administration failed to resolve. We were forced to close the college for a week so the Board of Management can put its house in order. "It is true a student who was taking videos of others pouring food was beaten. It is just a small misunderstanding which can be sorted out.” He reported that the student was not wounded. “We have seen him ... he is ok,” he said. The official further said that insecurity was the main reason why the TTI was closed; he said the chaos had gone beyond the college compound. “Students started throwing stones on moving vehicles along Namanga highway [so we felt the need to close the institution] for issues raised by the students to be resolved," he said. College principal Wesley Yegon neither replied phone calls nor replied SMSs for comment on the matter. Kanar said the students will be informed of the reporting date. Riot police surrounded the college for the better part of the day and ensured the smooth exit of the students. Click here for the latest political news
