Six senior Nairobi county government officials and a director of a company accused of corruption have denied the charges. They are Peter Gitau, Edna Nyaitond, Ephantus Gitonga, Allan Muchira, Benard Kigori, and Charles Gatheru - the director of Broadways Hardware and General Suppliers. They were arraigned before an Anti-Corruption Court. The lot is faced with five counts of conspiracy to commit an economic crime, committing a fraudulent act, wilful failure to comply with procurement laws, and deceiving by principal. The prosecution alleged that the county officials conspired with Broadways Hardware, the bidder who was awarded the tender, to defraud the county. It is alleged that they conspired to substitute the tender form which had a price of Sh50 million with another containing a higher price of Sh150 million. Nicholas Maina, another suspect, will take plea later . City magistrate Lawrence Mugambi released them on Sh400,000 bail pending trial. The pre-trial is scheduled for August 10.
