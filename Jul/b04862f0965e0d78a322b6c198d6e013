Former minister Ochilo Ayacko yesterday won 44 out of 70 ‘electoral college votes’ in an election conducted by ODM for the race for the Migori Senate Seat. Former Nyatike MP Omondi Anyanga got two votes. Eddy Oketch got one vote. All other candidates including former MPs Dalmas Otieno (Rongo) and John Pesa (Migori), former Migori speaker Gordon Ogolla, Solomon Hodo, Ogola Ogola, David Osiany and John Magaiwa got no vote. The seat fell vacant following the death of Senator Ben Oluoch last month. Oluoch’s eldest son Willis Okech and his cousin mark Okundi did not get votes. “The results were first transmitted to the national executive council today before we made it public in a peaceful voting process,” county ODM chairman Philip Makabong’o said. He said the election was free and fair. The party said it would not conduct a nomination through universal suffrage. Read:Ayacko gets 44 out 70 electoral college votes in Migori senator race
