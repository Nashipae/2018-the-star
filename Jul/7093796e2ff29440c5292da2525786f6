Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati (pictured) has told residents to give him more time to build and repair roads. He said the work will run smoothly once rain subsides. Wangamati spoke in Lugusi market. He inspected Webuye East and Webuye West roads. “By the end of this year or mid-next year, all roads will be passable. The heavy rain has disadvantaged us,” he said. “The ongoing rain is pounding the entire nation. I plead for patience.” Wangamati said work has begun on the Misikhu-Brigadier road. It had stalled but will be completed and opened for public use, he said. The county boss said the county plans to tarmac it from Lugulu market via the Lugusi market to the Misikhu-Brigadier road. He said better roads will improve the county economy and his administration will do all it can to ensure residents travel and ferry goods without problems. MCAs Paul Wamalwa (Matulo), Martin Wanyonyi (Ndivisi), Violet Makhanu (Mihuu) and Roads executive Collins Mukhongo accompanied the governor.
