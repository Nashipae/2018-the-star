National Treasury PS Kamau Thugge has explained how the Sh250 billion Eurobond acquired in 2014 was spent. He appeared before the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi to respond to the Auditor General’s report for the financial year 2014-15. He said both the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and Director of Public Prosecution investigated the matter and found the money was not misappropriated.

But the Opposition claimed at the time that Sh173 billion of the proceeds could not be accounted for. Thugge told MPs that Sh34 billion was spent on infrastructural projects in the financial year 2013-2014, while the remaining Sh215.4 billion was accounted for in the 2014-15 financial year. He said out of Sh215.4 billion, Sh53.2 billion was used to pay a syndicated loan while Sh162.2 billion was transferred to the Special sovereign bond account at the Central Bank of Kenya. Auditor General Edward Ouko had querried why the ministry drew Sh34 billion from the fund to spend on infrastructure in July 2014 and accounted for it in financial year 2013-14. “You received the Eurobond on July 3 when you had already crossed to the financial year 2014-15. How come you are accounting for it in the year ended June 30, 2014? All financial years end in June 30,” Suna East MP Junet Mohammed asked.

The Sh34 billion was supposed to fund infrustructural projects in 2013-14. The money had been approved by Parliament, but the financing came late,” he said. In 2016, Ouko told the then Public Accounts Committee that they were organising trips to grill officials of seven foreign banks over the Eurobond scandal. He said his officials would travel to the Middle East, Europe and America to probe the matter. Ouko said they would question officials of Barclays Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, Qatar National Bank, ICBC Standard Bank, JP Security, Citi Transactional Service of New York and JP Morgan Chase. In May 2016, the then Director of Public Prosecution Keriako Tobiko said there was no evidence to support the alleged theft of this cash. “Upon independent review of the evidence I have found no evidence to support the allegation about the alleged misappropriation of Sh250 billion,” Tobiko said.
