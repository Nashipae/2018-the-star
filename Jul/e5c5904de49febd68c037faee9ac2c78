The Pharmacy and Poisons Board (PPB) has recalled four batches of Gentamicin Injection BP 80mg for investigations into side effects. The recall came on Wednesday due to suspected cases of batch-specific adverse reactions of severe headaches as reported by some patients after injection. In a statement, the board identified the batches as Gentamed injection batch numbers 170611 and 170603; Caregenta-80 injection batch number 171160; and Dawagenta injection batch number 170754, which will all expire in 2020. "The recall is being done in consultation with market authorization holders (Medisel Kenya Ltd, Care plus Kenya Ltd and Dawa Kenya Limited) as a precautionary measure to allow investigations," the board said. “We have alerted health care professionals [given] details of the recall procedure and advised them to check their stock and immediately quarantine products from the affected batches." The board noted that there will be no shortage as this is not a complete withdrawal of the products from the market. It asked the public to report suspected adverse reactions to medicines and vaccines through its online reporting system, www.pv.pharmacyboardkenya.org. Gentamicin injection is an antimicrobial agent most commonly used to treat serious and potentially life-threatening infections, such as chest infections, urinary tract infections and infected wounds or burns. It can be used by both children and adults and is primarily used in hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. Click here for the latest political news
