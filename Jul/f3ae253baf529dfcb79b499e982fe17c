A girl whose photo went viral on social media for hanging precariously on a motorbike ferrying firewood in Elgeyo Marakwet can now smile after a local NGO offered to pay her school fees. Faith Jepchirchir, 13, a Standard 5 pupil, was last week captured near Kamotony Forest in Kapsowar on top of firewood. According to a local daily, she had accompanied her grandmother Lilian Kobilo, 75, to the forest 4km away from their home to fetch firewood.  The granny has been raising Jepchirchir and her two siblings since their mother deserted them. Kobilo's only source of income is from the sale of firewood. After her story was published, ‘Soles for African Child’, a Nairobi-based NGO intervened.

The NGO did shopping for the family, bought 10 pairs of shoes and offered to pay Jepchirchir's fees until she completes secondary school.  In a previous interview, the girl had said she would buy 100 pairs of shoes with her first salary. Her headteacher Salina Mumol said Jepchirchir is a hardworking, kind and focused girl. However, the problems at home affected her self-esteem.  While receiving the donations, Jepchirchir said could not believe "such an innocent ride would bring her favour". "I am grateful and may God bless you. I promise to work hard and make you and my grandmother proud," she said. Click here for the latest political stories
