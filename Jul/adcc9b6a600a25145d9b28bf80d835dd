The new County executives appointed by Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua have been gazetted amid protest by the assembly. The notice, signed by Mutua is contained in the current issue of the official Kenya Gazette. It gives the seven who were sworn in last Monday by Machakos Chief Magistrate Alfred Kibiru, the legal status to undertake their respective tasks. The seven include Evelyn Mutie (Energy, Lands and Housing), Morris Aluanga (Roads, Transport and Public Works), Titus Nzeki (County Administration and Decentralized) and Francis Mwaka (Trade). Others are Kimeu Mbithi (Public Service), Urbanus Musyoka (Agriculture ) and Lazarus Kivuva (Education). The appointment of the CECs sparked bitter exchange between a section of the MCA'MCAs the governor. The MCAs claimed the appointments were illegal. Led by the leader of the majority, Mark Muendo the MCA's had warned that the new executives would be held individually liable for prosecution should they go ahead and transact any business on behalf of the county government. Through a statement, the Machakos executive accused the ward representatives of misleading the county residents over the appointments, arguing that the period allocated to the assembly to approve or reject the nominees had elapsed. "From May 17, 2018, when the names were presented, time lapsed on June 29 2018," read the statement by the head of press Mutinda Mwanzia.
