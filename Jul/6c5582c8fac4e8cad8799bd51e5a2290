Young people should use their talent to develop themselves instead of abusing drugs and alcohol, a psychologist said.
Kiambu-based psychologist Gladys Chania yesterday said many youths abuse drugs and alcohol because of peer pressure.
She spoke at the Rainbow Resort Hotel in Ruiru town, Kiambu, when she attended the Mr and Miss Birmingham Kenya 2018 competition.
Bridgit Kanini was crowned Miss Birmingham Kenya, while Wycliffe Mageto won the Mr Birmingham title.Â  Kanini said she would campaign against drug abuse.
