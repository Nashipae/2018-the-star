An MP has blamed parents and government's 'treatment of students as if they are eggs' for the deteriorating discipline among learners. Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo said it is high time corporal punishment was reintroduced in schools for teachers to instil
discipline in students. "We must first stop treating our
children like eggs and ensure that we have values. The kids must grow up
knowing that what is right is rewarded and what is wrong is punished." Odhiambo said: "If somebody burns a building or does something
wrong, they must be caned." "We need to give the teachers the power to
punish these children," he said. At least 47 public secondary
schools have been affected by the wave of unrest for the last three months, in some cases leading to loss of property worth millions. Odhiambo, whose constituency has also borne the
brunt of school fires, said there was need to unearth the root causes of
the infernos. "We need to establish who brings petrol to schools
for these children to use? Are they watchmen or who is behind all these.
Investigators should broaden their scope." The
legislator further said that there is need to review the country's
political systems saying that students 'copy-paste' what they see in the national
arena. "We need to ensure that democracy does not spoil our moral
values. What the kids see when we demonstrate in the streets is
what they practice at schools," he said. On Tuesday, a 60-
capacity dormitory at Maliera High School in Gem constituency, Siaya
County, was burnt after students demanded a new bus. Principal
Samuel Oyondi said signs of a plan to destroy the school's property were
seen after the students issued a notice demanding a bus. When he visited the school last week, the MP said, the students maintained their hard stance that they needed a bus. "Students must know that their words cannot become law and that Rome was not built in a day," he said. Click here for the latest political news
