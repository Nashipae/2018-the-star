Acting National Youth Service director general Matilda Sakwa yesterday put on notice those who use the agency to steal public funds. She told the Star in an interview that her main responsibility will be to restore credibility in the state institution. The outgoing Machakos county commissioner said corruption erodes the gains made to empower the youth. The NYS has been rocked by scandals, the latest being the loss of Sh698 million. Former director general Richard Ndubai and Youth PS Lillian Omollo have been charged alongside others with the theft. Ndubai took over from Nelson Githinji. Githinji was also charged alongside others with the loss of cash. They were acquitted. “It’s morally wrong when you betray the trust given to lead an organisation that brings hope to the youth. I thank the government for entrusting me with the assignment,” Sakwa said. Sakwa has a Master’s degree in Development Studies (Politics of Alternative Development Strategies) from the International Institute of Social Studies at the Hague, Netherlands and a Bachelor of Arts (Sociology and Religious Studies) from the University of Nairobi. She has  been a county commissioner for Nandi and Elgeyo Marakwet, where she coordinated programmes such as peace building and conflict management.
