A large delegation of Kenyan sports officials and politicians has gone to Russia to watch the World Cup. It may include up to 28 MPs, five senators and 40 government officials. Some have been there since June 16. Why are they there? Last year Kenya failed to host the Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) as government was short of money and considered the games a low priority. It therefore cannot be a study tour as Kenya is unlikely to host any football tournament in the foreseeable future. If it is not a study tour, it is a joyride. The politicians and officials have gone to Russia to enjoy themselves. We would also like to enjoy ourselves at the World Cup, especially if it was paid for by the state. Instead we content ourselves with watching the matches on TV. After the debacle in Rio in 2016, government promised that no money would be squandered again on travelling to prestige sports events. But it has been. What can we say?  Quote of the day: "The most important part of vehicle maintenance is clean windows, so if you are broken down you will enjoy the beauty of the view."
