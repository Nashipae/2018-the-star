Only two samples of sugar seized from Eastleigh during the swoop on contrabands had copper, the Kenya Bureau of Standards has said. Kebs MD Moses Ikiria on Tuesday said all the other samples for the 1.2 million bags did not test positive for heavy metals. He said the samples of the seized contraband sugar were tested for mercury, arsenic, lead, and copper. "The other samples did not report any traces of heavy metals," he said in a report presented to MPs.

Ikiria said 157,392 bags of sugar complied with the standards while 837,244 bags didn’t meet the necessary standards. "Some 705,000 of the 837,244 bags are waiting to be reprocessed. This means 132,224 failed testing." The test focused on the moisture content, the presence of yeast and mould, fade on colour, and total viable count as well as clarity of the sugar. However, the agency said there were some samples that didn’t have all the required information. They were 13 samples which represented about 271, 675 bags. "Four samples complied whereas nine did not. The ones that did not comply was on moisture content, yeast and mould, colour, total viable count and clarity of the sugar; not heavy metals." Ikiria said that scientists from the agency said the sugar is not pathogenic hence poses no health risk to the public. The report includes the county where the sugar was seized, date, place found on location, number bags recovered, status of the sugar, sample and test results. The report handed over to the Agriculture Committee includes market surveillance samples taken from different outlets in the country. On market surveillance, the agency drew 207 samples from 47 counties. Out of these, 53 samples from 17 counties were tested. About 1,319,668 50 kg bags of sugar was seized in different locations.
