The huge Maasai Mau Forest where people are being evicted borders on group ranches. Sometime back, the group ranches extended their boundaries into the forests. It was illegal but they were allowed by the local authorities. The groups started subdividing farms and selling them to Kenyans. Most of the people who bought land are from Bomet and Kericho. They had titles, which were wrongly issued, but they were valid. The people poured in and elected their own MP. The people in Maasailand become angry because they said they had an MP from Bomet in their home, Narok county. Last year we had a very bad season when rivers dried up. People started finding out why we didn’t have water. The government established that we had many people in Mau. When the government checked the titles, it claimed they were fake. So they had to evict them so that the forest can survive. It was decided at a very high level. In fact, at one point the deputy announced the eviction. When the people were told to move out, they were not happy. The forest policy allows the government to protect forests at all costs. They first send in the chief and the people refused to move out. Then they send the county commissioner, then the regional commissioner. In fact, some have been compensated but went back after they took advantage following the 2013 and 2017 polls to claim they are in power. The government has to act because it has realised that without Mau we will not have water in Lake Nakuru and in the River Mara that flows through the Serengeti and Maasai Mara National Park. I don’t like the violence meted out on poor people. They should have a proper way of doing it. Many of Kenya's forests are settled in illegally. Politicians should not take advantage of poor people. They are around 200, 000 hectares across the nation. It’s time the government decided to remove everyone from the forest. The forest expert spoke to the Star
