Camels have developed resistance to a drug used to treat surra, a common and often deadly disease. Triquin drug has been in the market for over 20 years, Kenya Biotechnology Research Institute director Judith Chemuliti said. “The drug is not working effectively. We are seeking to develop a new drug to help camel keepers from Isiolo and Marsabit deal with camel trypanosomiasis commonly known as surra,” she said. Chemuliti said the disease causes many death and significant reduction of milk. She spoke yesterday at the Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organisation Muguga station. A three-year study of the disease funded by the African Union for Sh70 million will be carried out in Northeastern Kenya and Northwestern Somalia. Joseph Githinji, Isiolo county director of eterinary services, said more people in the area are getting into camel production because unlike cattle, goats and sheep, the animal withstands drought. A new drug, he said, will improve production. The county has more than 45,000 camels and “the research could not have come at a better time,” Githinji said. Camel milk is a major source of livelihood for the community. It sells more than 3,000 litres of camel milk in Nairobi at Sh150 per litre,Githinji said. Wario Sori, a livestock officer in Marsabit county, said there has been little study of camels in Kenya. “Eighty per cent of this community relies on livestock and we have a population of over 200,000 camels. This research will be a good opportunity since we have been having a problem with camel diseases, especially with no reference in terms of disease control,” Wario said.
