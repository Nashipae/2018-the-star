FBI dance crew is one of the biggest dance crews in Kenya, having represented the country around the world. They have won international awards, from award shows to competitions. You might look at them and think they have the best life, but you just don't know the stories behind their success. About two or so years ago, they represented the country at a dance competition, but surviving while in Las Vegas was a huge problem. In an interview with Adelle and Shaffie, they said they couldn't afford a place to sleep, and sometimes didn't have money to buy food. They had to survive on soda and bread for 21 days. The deprivation affected the dancers to the point some of them would faint because of missing meals. This was detrimental, considering they needed all the energy they could get to dance their hearts away and bring the prize back home. The people who promised to support them accommodation didn't fulfil their promise. After they reached out to them, they said they couldn't support them and that they should go to Washington, at the Kenyan Embassy, and there they would get tickets to come back home. But even if that was the case, how would they get to Washington, yet they didn't even have money to buy food? "On the last week, God came through. We got support from Kenyans who live in Las Vegas, and they provided food and other things we needed."
