Police in Homa Bay are investigating the abduction of a contractor’s son. Larmeck Ogolla’s child Shedrick Otieno is said to have been kidnapped on Tuesday by two men. Ogolla said the two were in a private car when they picked up the 10-year-old at around 6am. The kidnappers are asking for a Sh10 million ransom. Otieno and his sister were at Stage Miwa on the Homa Bay- Kendu Bay Road waiting for the school bus. Otieno is a Standard Three pupil at Janeiro Academy in Rangwe constituency. Ogolla said, “They approached the boy and lied to him that I was calling him back home. When he refused one man forcibly pushed him into the car.” Ogolla on yesterday connected the incident to his wedding to wife Rose in Homa Bay town last Saturday. The wedding was attended by National Assembly Minority leader John Mbadi, Ndhiwa MP Martin Owino and former MPs Oyugi Magwanga (Kasipul) and Sylvance Osele (Kabondo Kasipul). “Some people think I received a lot of money during the wedding but most envelops only contained congratulatory cards,” he added. Ogolla urged the police to expedite investigations. “One person telephoned me on Tuesday night and threatened to kill the child if I refuse to give them the money,” Ogolla said. The contractor said his family has been frustrated since the wedding. In a separate incident, a motorcyclist went to the school and asked to ferry the children back home on Monday evening. He was not allowed. Homa Bay police commander Marius Tum said they have received crucial information that would lead to arrests.
