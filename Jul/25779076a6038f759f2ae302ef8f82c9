The Nairobi government will on Friday release Sh1 billion owed to road contractors by the previous administration, Governor Mike Sonko has said. He said road projects had stalled, but they were revived early this year. “The projects had stalled because some contractors claimed they had not been paid. My government will make sure they are paid,” Sonko said. He spoke on Saturday during the launch of Nairobi cleanup day in Matopeni. Sonko said, however, the county will only pay the contractors upon verification of ongoing projects and completed ones. The governor ordered a thorough scrutiny of all road projects before payments are made. Governor Evans Kidero’s administration had undertaken 64 road and infrastructure projects. Out of 44 road projects in various wards 14 have been completed, while 18 are ongoing. The status of 12 others is “unknown”. Twelve projects were undertaken on the highways, while four involved street lighting. The county government had contracted 65 contractors. The companies include Kualam Ltd, Yomason Contractors Ltd, Tuanze Ltd, Salma Investments Company, Kabiro Contractors, Blue Nile (EA) Ltd, Mumusa Industries, RealTime Builders and RoadMap Contractors Ltd. In this year’s budget, Public Works, Transport and Infrastructure was allocated the largest share at Sh5.4 billion. Of the amount, Sh4.2 billion will go towards projects aimed at decongesting the city. The rest of the money will be spent on road safety interventions, including building bridges and traffic management. Sonko had previously accused the former county administration of misappropriating funds. He said Sh3.2 billion allocated for roads repair in 2016-17 was shared among county officials. The city’s capital has been put on the spot over the poor status of roads. The Kenya Urban Roads Authority has assisted in the rehabilitation of most county roads as decided by
