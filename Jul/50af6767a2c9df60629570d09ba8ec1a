Maliera Boys' Secondary School in Siaya County was closed indefinitely on Thursday after students went on strike demanding a bus and weekly entertainment. The strike was reportedly to take place on Tuesday. Principal Samuel Oyondi, who announced the closure, said the learners tried to burn the library on Wednesday night “We were to single out the ringleaders but this could have led to massive destruction of school property through a strike so we sent all of them home,” said Oyondi. He said the school will be reopened on Tuesday and a meeting of the board and stakeholders held for long-term solutions. Oyondi urged parents to advise their children against striking. “We have talked to the students on several occlusions on matters of discipline but it seems our advice falls on deaf ears. We want parents to intervene and instill values while they are at home," he said. The Principal noted the peculiarity of strikes within days at three schools in the county. He regretted that there were no interventions to prevent the chaos. Ng’iya Girls' Secondary School in Alego/Usonga Sub-county and Maranda Boys' High school in Bondo Sub-county are the other institutions that have been closed.
