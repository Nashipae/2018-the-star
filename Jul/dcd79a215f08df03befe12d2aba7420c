Police in Kilimani have arrested two suspects suspected to be involved in an online car theft syndicate. Eric Wabwire Ilode, 27 and Simon Muchemi, 30, were arrested on Saturday for fraud under OB NO 87/29/06/2018. “The two were arrested at a showroom along Kiambu road following a trap that was laid by officers from this command after we received several complaints that there is a criminal gang who were conning unsuspecting people millions of shillings by pretending to be genuine car dealers,” reads the police report. Police suspect the two are among a group of conmen who post messages on facebook advertising different cars for sale on as importers, agents of city motors ltd or direct importers. 'Once contacted, they arrange for a meeting with the customers at any showroom and convince them that they are genuine motor vehicle dealers and then receive payment either in cash or bank deposit,' police say. After receiving money, the suspects disappear and switch off the mobile numbers. Click here for the latest political news
