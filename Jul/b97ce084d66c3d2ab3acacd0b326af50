An MCA in Baringo County has reportedly gone missing after he was abducted by unknown people on Sunday. Nelson Lotela of Silale Ward was allegedly abducted by three unknown people at around 4 pm at Nginyang river in Tiaty Sub-County. "He was forced out of his vehicle near Nginyang bridge before being ordered into another black double cabin vehicle with hidden registration number which sped off towards Nakuru," a witness told the Star. Separate sources gave the registration number of the car as a Nissan Navara KCA 212B. The vehicle was reportedly being escorted by a Black Land Cruiser with a hidden number plate.
