Persons diagnosed with drug-resistant TB spend Sh145,109 annually on treatment, a new report shows. Despite the cost of TB diagnosis and treatment being free of charge in the country, patients still bear the brunt of looking for the elusive treatment. The TB patients cost survey terms the out of pocket expenditure as catastrophic, especially among families living below the poverty line. “TB patients incur large costs related to illness and disability, including medical, transport and costs related to loss of income. These high costs create barriers to access and adherence to medication, thereby increasing the risk of disease transmission,” Eunice Mailu, the programme officer at the National Leprosy, Drug and TB programme, said yesterday at a Nairobi hotel. Read: Cheaper treatment for drug-resistant TB Eighty per cent of the amount used by TB patients was used to buy nutritional supplement. Some 1,353 patients from 30 different counties participated in the study, which was done last year. Other 1,071 patients were on drug-resistant treatment, while 282 were diagnosed with sensitive TB, which means the illness was not cured by the first line TB drugs. In the study, 63 per cent of drug-resistant TB patients were fired for not being able to work. Another 36 per cent were stigmatised by their families. TB programmes in the country are mainly supported by donors but not all costs are covered. As such,  some families end up taking loans, selling their assets, or using their savings for diagnosis and treatment “Although treatment is free, the additional costs are making it hard for patients to have a proper diet,” Amilu said. Data from the Ministry of Health shows 85, 188 people were diagnosed with TB last year. Out of these, 577 had drug-resistant TB.
