Residents of Wajir and business people are urging the government not to extend the ban on animal slaughter and meat sales following the outbreak of Rift Valley Fever. Businesses have suffered heavy losses and meat-eating residents say they too have suffered because they hate vegetables, which are rare. The ban was issued on June 7 lapses on Thursday. Six people have died of the disease and at least  80 others are admitted in county hospitals. County Health executive Abdihakim Billow says no new cases have been reported for three weeks. Meat sellers and owners of abattoirs want authorities to lift the ban to save their business. They said they have already suffered major losses. Wajir butchers’ association chairman Mohamed Osman yesterday urged veterinarians, national and county officials to declare the area RFV-free. “Thank God we have not had new RFV cases in three weeks. This confirms authorities have curbed it. There is no need to continue subjecting residents to this suffering,” Osman said. He said residents also have suffered because they have not been able to enjoy their  favourite meat. Wajir  livestock market chairman Abdi Hussein said traders supported the ban but it was time to lift it.“Life has stopped since the ban,” he said. “This community depends on livestock, it’s the only food we know. You can imagine what they have been eating all those weeks. Not many people like vegetables, which are rare,” Hussein said. A resident, Halima Hussein, 60, said she has never gone for so long without meat. “I have never been subjected to such suffering. These authorities are so determined we don’t eat meat at all,” she said. Health CEC Billow was not clear about lifting the ban, saying only that the matter cannot be decided by an individual.
