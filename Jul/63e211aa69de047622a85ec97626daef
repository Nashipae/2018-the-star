An elderly man was killed on Thursday night as attacks on the Elgeyo Marakwet and West Pokot border continues. The man was killed at about 9pm in Kapyego, Marakwet East. The killing pushes the death toll to three after two people were killed in separate attacks on Sunday and Monday. Marakwet East deputy county commissioner James Chacha said raiders stormed the man's home and killed him. Chacha said police have been deployed to the border to hunt down the attackers. “We held meetings on Monday and Tuesday and elders resolved that we maintain peace. It is unfortunate the attack occurred,” Chacha said. He said police were following crucial leads. “We have temporarily suspended peace meetings to allow the officers carry out a thorough investigation into the attacks,” Chacha said. Residents linked the raids to retaliatory attacks. The border is notorious for cattle rustling. Former Kapyego MCA Benson Kiptire blamed leaders from the two counties for failing to restore peace on the volatile border. “Elected leaders are not championing for peace because they have vested political interests. I'm asking religious to help us preach peace between communities living on the border,” Kiptire said. Classes have been disrupted in Kamelei, Kalya and Tenderwa primary schools. The schools, located on the border, were closed on Monday and Tuesday following the attacks. James Kipkore said residents from Marakwet East have fled with their livestock to Kapyego and Kaptalamwa while those from the West Pokot side have moved to Kapsangar and Tarbach areas. “Tension is high. Bandits armed with guns shoot in the air every night in readiness for a fight,” Kipkore said. He asked the government to flash bandits out of the forest. "The state should also stop any activities in the forest for the sake of peace,” he said. The attacks brings banditry death toll along the border to five following the shooting of two other people three weeks ago.
