Two Form Three girls who went missing for the past one month were found yesterday in Malindi. Maria Waithera and Purity Wanjiru of Ngarariga Girls Secondary School, Limuru, were staying with some boys in Maweni slum in Malindi town. They sought to help them after the person who promised them jobs disappeared. Malindi police boss Matawa Muchangi said the girls were taken to a police station for questioning by DCI officers. On Tuesday, their mothers appealed to them to come back home. Two women who rescued them and reported to the police said they were on the outskirts of the slum but later relocated to the interior after the boys offered them a place to stay. Florence Kazungu said they learnt about the girls after their disappearance was in the news. She said she had been seeing them for the last one month and never knew they had escaped from their homes. “As a parent, I was touched by the news and began searching for them. Surprisingly when we questioned them, they said they were sorry for the mistake they did,’’ Kazungu said. Beatrice Tuva said they suspect the girls were promised jobs at a tourist resort. “It’s like the person who invited them could not be reached,” she said.
