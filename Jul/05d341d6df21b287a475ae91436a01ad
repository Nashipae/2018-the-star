Former transport CS Michael Kamau has failed to take a plea for the second time before the anti-corruption court and wants his appeal determined at the Supreme Court. "I plead with the anti-corruption court to stop my criminal proceedings until the Supreme Court hears and determines my appeal," he said through lawyer James Orengo. The embattled engineer is fighting to have the case pending before anti-corruption court quashed. Trial magistrate Douglas Ogot was told that Kamau filed an appeal before the Supreme Court and that the application was certified as urgent. “It is our prayer that this plea be differed to another date pending hearing and determination of the application before the Supreme Court,” submitted lawyer Orengo.

The state argued that there was no order stopping Kamau's plea taking and pleaded with the court to dismiss his application. Kamau has been fighting against his prosecution insisting it is witchhunt based on pure malice. The DPP recommended that he be charged afresh with abuse of office and flouting of tender rules. The court will give it's ruling on July 6. Also read: EACC raids ex-CS Michael Kamau's home over Sh33 million tender Click here for the latest political news
