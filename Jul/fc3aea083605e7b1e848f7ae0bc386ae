The Nairobi government will open three rehabilitation centres to fight alcohol and drug abuse. Nairobi deputy county commissioner Stephen Kihara has called for a multi-sectoral approach to deal addiction.He says drug abuse in the city will continue if it is not dealt with. “Drug abuse can have serious effects on a person’s physical health, mental health and overall well-being,” Kihara said. Nairobi City County Alcoholic Drinks Control and Licensing Board (NCCADCL) chairman Kennedy Odhiambo said excessive consumption of alcohol and drug abuse in parts of the city has reached a crisis level. Speaking during a workshop at Maisha Poa Centre in Dagoretti South on Thursday, Odhiambo said the board is keen to reform troubled youth in Dagoretti North and South constituencies. He said a rehab centre will be opened soon in Riruta. “Procurement has started and it is a matter of time before the tender is awarded,” he said. Enforcement committee chairman Mutunga Mutungi urged the board to close wines and spirits outlets operating with business permits instead of liquor licences.
