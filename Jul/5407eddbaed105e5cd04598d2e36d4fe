The government has been given seven days to resettle the families flushed out of the Mau Forest. Bomet woman representative Joyce Korir on Tuesday told the government to issue title deeds to genuine landowners and find alternative parcels for the landless. She said the officers in charge of the operation “exceeded their limits”. They harass anyone, including those living outside the forest, and subject them to unnecessary suffering, she said. “What we are witnessing is not what the government told us. We see a situation where our people are being ejected from their homes forcibly, even those who are not in the forest. It’s so disgusting and we won’t tolerate it anymore,” Korir said. “We  want the government to resettle these people immediately so they can continue leading their normal lives. Children suffer more because their schools have also been demolished.” The legislator spoke in Bomet where she distributed Sh7.5 million cheques to women and youth groups and persons living with disability. More than 100 groups benefitted. At the wekeend, Korir and Bomet Central MP Ronald Tonui visited the evicted families in parts of Narok South. Tonui criticised the government for the manner it was carrying out the operation. Korir lashed out at Narok county commissioner George Natembeya for his remarks that their visit to the area was meant to incite the evictees. She said they represent their people wherever they are. “Natembeya should know the majority of those living here and now affected are our voters,” she said.
