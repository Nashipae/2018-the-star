An MCA from Homa Bay county has asked Governor Okoth
Obado to resign after his move to reject ODM nominee  Ochilo Ayako. Ayacko who lost to Obado in the 2017 governorship race is the ODM`s choice for the Migori  senatorial seat. The seat was left vacant after the death of Ben Oluoch. Nominated MCA, Nancy Anyango said Obado's utterance reflected that he no longer believes in the party ideologies thus should resign as per the law requirement. Anyango said  the decision was firmly backed up by the party by-laws, constitution, and political parties act. "The assertion that Governor Obado will oppose the candidature of  Ayako and will probably go it alone to campaign and support a non-ODM candidate in the the senate polls is not only laughable but outrightly unlawful. The Migori Governor is unknowingly hurtling toward political wilderness in a bid to seek political relevance by engaging himself in desperate brinkmanship that is bound to flop," She said.

"ODM
remains the most formidable political force in the County of Migori and
the Luo Nyanza region and no amount of rhetoric will change this
reality. If a party member change his beliefs, or joins another
party or engage in acts that are incompatible with his party’s policies,
article 103(1)(e) of the Constitution stipulates that the member shall
be deemed to have resigned from his party," she said Obado yesterday stirred controversy after he rejected the direct
nomination of his political rival Ochillo Ayacko as the party’s
candidate in the forthcoming Senate by-election. Click here for the latest political news
