Tatu City has launched an academy in Kiambu to provide hands-on training in masonry and plumbing.Tatu City country director Nick Langford yesterday said the academy has so far trained 75 youths since it began operations in December.“The Tatu City Training Academy was founded in response to the wishes of residents to acquire specialist skills in the construction industry,” he said during the launch of the academy. “Tatu City is dedicated to its host communities and pleased to work with the Kiambu government to empower the youth and create jobs.” Upon completion after a six-week course the graduates will receive certificates validated by the National Construction Authority.So far, 85 per cent of those who have benefited from the training are working with contractors in Tatu City.Langford said all contractors working in Tatu City are required to hire from the local community.

He said employment is the biggest challenge facing the community.Nyoro urged residents to support Tatu City project as a substitute to the troubled coffee farming. “Debate on whether coffee land should go be turned to ‘concrete jungle’ has mixed reactions, but the most important thing is the value it brings to the community,” he said.He said coffee farmers got to a point where they were unable to meet basic needs such as healthcare.
