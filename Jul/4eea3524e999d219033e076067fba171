COTU boss Francis Atwoli has asked Western leaders to call for a crisis meeting and solve their differencesÂ in order to unite the Luhya nation. The COTU boss said a united Western region will have strong bargaining power in the 2022 succession politics. "They should meet urgently, let them not delay us. Other regions are meeting and mapping their way forward and we should not be let out," he said. He added, "We cannot remain as beggars. We must be inside and nearer to the negotiating table and we must be represented when decisions are made. We cannot sit and wait for 2022". Atwoli said politicians from other regions have taken advantage of the Luhya disunity and invaded the region during elections to split votes. "This time round we must ensure we vote as a block. If we really want to have a bigger stake in the 2022 leadership this is our time," he said. Atwoli's sentiments come after a cross section of Western leaders led by Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa asked Bungoma senator Moses Wetangula to ditch NASA and join the Jubilee party. The leaders told Wetangula to stop hanging in an "abusive relationship". "Kikiumana huko mujue tuko hii pande ingine na tuko na nafasi. Ambia senator tuko tayari kama serikali baada ya handshake aje ajiunge nasi tufanyie wana nchi kazi," Wamalwa said. (When things are not working on your side, cross over this side(Jubilee). We have lots of space. He was accompanied by Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu and Mumias East MP Benjami Washiali. Wamalwa and Wetangula who for the past nine years had not seen eye to eye earlier on ended their truce last week and announced to work in unity for the community. The two said they will foster peace during the Bukusu Mabanga Declaration. Read:Ditch NASA's abusive relationship, Wamalwa asks Wetangula
