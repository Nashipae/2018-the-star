The Kakamega government has entered into an agreement with the Rural Electrification Authority (REA) to ease residents’ access to electricity.   
The programme will be implemented in five years, starting this year. Under the agreement, REA and the county government will pool resources to subsidise connectivity in the 60 wards.
Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and REA managing director Peter Mbugua signed the agreement on Friday in Nairobi.
Oparanya said his government will transfer Sh60 million to REA every year for the programme.
REA will provide a similar amount annually towards power connectivity in the county.
Mbugua said every shilling paid by the county will be matched by REA to ensure successful implementation and coverage of the entire county by 2022.
The MD said his organisation’s  budgetary allocation for 2017-18 and 2018-19 has been enhanced to Sh14 billion for rural electrification to cover all wards in the county and work is in progress in some counties.
Oparanya said transformers will be installed in all the 60 wards in the county for the connections by REA. “The very poor among the community will be assisted to get power through the Last Mile Connectivity Programme,” he said.
Oparanya said the programme will encourage cottage industries in the county, besides enhancing security.
In his pre-election campaigns, Oparanya had promised to ensure every household in the county is connected to the national grid.
The county has 355,679 households, according to the 2009 census. It had a population of 1,660,651 in 2009 but the population is currently estimated to be more than two million.
