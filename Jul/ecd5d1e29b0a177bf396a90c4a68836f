National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has slammed courts for repealing laws passed after thorough research and public input. Muturi on Sunday said the Senate and National Assembly do a lot, including debates and seeking advice from the Attorney General. He attended Embu senator Njeru Ndiwga’s thanksgiving ceremony at Kibugu ACK. Muturi was with his Senate colleague Kenneth Lusaka. The National Assembly speaker said it is disheartening when lawmakers’ work is thrown away. Muturi said the law should be amended to only allow the Supreme Court to interpret laws. In May, the High Court temporarily suspended sections of the Cybercrime law. Justice John Mativo issued the order in the case in which the Bloggers Association of Kenya sued the AG, Muturi, Inspector General of Police and the DPP over the Computer Misuse and Cyber Crimes Act 2018. Bloggers said the disputed law contains provisions which deny, infringe and threaten freedom of expression, media and persons besides the right to privacy, property and a fair hearing. Speaking in Embu, Muturi said after such a rigorous processes and in order to give credence to the three arms of government, it should be clear at what level laws can be challenged. Meanwhile, Lusaka said the Senate and National Assembly, county assembly and governors have been working in unity and improved development, unlike in the previous term.
