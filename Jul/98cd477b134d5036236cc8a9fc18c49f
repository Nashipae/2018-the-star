Treasury is looking into ways of selling Treasury bonds through private placement, a copy of a letter it sent to fund managers showed yesterday. Ministry officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters. Government bonds have been sold through open auctions conducted by the Central Bank. Treasury invited managers to a meeting on Friday. “The purpose of the meeting will be to undertake a market sounding exercise towards the issuance and to discuss and agree on the bond’s pricing methodology,” the letter read. Private placement involves the sale of securities to a relatively small number of select investors. Investors involved can include large banks, mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds.
