The Court of Appeal on Friday nullified the election of Embakasi South MP Julius Mawathe. Justice Mohammed Warsame said the election was not conducted in a free and fair manner. “We observed that the learned judge at the High Court did not address the facts well before her, by saying the appellant Irshad Sumra, failed to prove his allegations on the scrutiny of the results,” Warsame said. Appeal judges Warsame, Kathurima M’inoti and Daniel Musinga said Mawathe’s election is nullified. They directed the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to hold a fresh poll after 60 days.

He said the certificate of MP Mawathe (Wiper party) be set aside pending a new election. The judges said there was a likelihood of bias in the election. Mawathe had been declared validly elected when former MP Sumra, who lost in the August 2017 election, filed a petition and went to the Court of Appeal. ODM’s Sumra convinced the appeal judges that the election was a sham. After the verdict, Sumra told the media said he was happy with the outcome and is prepared for a by-election. He told Mawathe not to go to the higher court and instead prepare for by-election if indeed he won the election free and fair. Click here for
