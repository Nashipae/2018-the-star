Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo (pictured) told the Ford Kenya leader that he has the right to quit if he is dissatisfied. Wetang’ula had said NASA is dead and would build his party to make it stronger. Wetang’ula was replaced as the Senate Minority by James Orengo. Yesterday, Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa disagreed with his party boss and said Ford-K is still in NASA.  Odhiambo said he will go for the National Assembly deputy chief whip if the party pulls out of the coalition. It is currently held by Wamalwa. “I will not shy away from claiming the seat of the deputy minority chief whip even if it means lobbying,” he said on the phone.
