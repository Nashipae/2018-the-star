Two legislators have urged Kenyans to ignore the “shoddy” National Assembly report on sugar and instead buy the commodity from Tanzania. Nyatike MP Tom Odege and his Uriri counterpart Mark Nyamita said it is wrong for their colleagues in the National Assembly to give a “shoddy” report on contraband sugar. The two said the special parliamentary committee co-chaired by MPs Kanini Kega (Kieni) and Adan Ali (Mandera South) did a substandard job. They spoke on Saturday at Chamchichi SDA Church in Nyatike during a funds drive. “We are next to Tanzania and we tell Migori county residents to avoid Kenyan sugar in totality as it is unfit for consumption. They should get their produce from across the border where it is safer,” Odege said. He said the joint committee on Trade and Agriculture and Livestock tabled its preliminary report but “failed to offer Kenyans any hope”. “Kenyans in sugar-growing areas don’t have any faith in the safety of sugar. If our government has failed us, we will seek alternatives in Tanzania,” Odege said.  REJECTED Nyamita said the report and the way the MPs conducted the probe will not help the ailing sector. “As far as we are concerned as legislators from the sugar-growing zone, we reject it in its totality,” he said. “We need to know the exact shortage and what should be imported. The report didn’t give the way forward on how to destroy contaminated sugar.” National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi on Friday gave MPs investigating the sugar scandal 10 days to determine if the commodity in the market is safe. Muturi questioned the seriousness of the parliamentary committee and described the report as work in progress. “The issue of health is important because this House and the country needs to know what they are consuming,” he said.
