Bura MP Ali Wario has told the ministry of Education to investigate the root cause of unrest in schools, which has left over 50 institutions burnt. After assessing the damage at Bangale Secondary School, which was burnt on Friday last week, Wario said the vicious circle of burning schools must stop. He said it is not enough to arrest and charge the culprits but it is important to address the causes. Hirimani Secondary Schools in Bura was also torched. “If this unrest is not addressed now, then we are staring at a ticking time bomb,” he said. “It is high time we looked at this issue holistically and from a policy perspective. It is one thing to blame and another to arrest. The ministry of Education should critically look at it and get to the bottom of it.” He regretted that those leading in the strike and burning of schools are children from poor families, whose parents can hardly afford school fees and feed their families. “It breaks my heart as a parent to learn that it is students from the poor of the poorest families that are leading the strikes. Those we are fronting to support through bursaries. It is wrong and unacceptable,” Wario said. He said Parliament is ready to support the ministry by making laws and policies to end the unrest. “What these students easily seem to forget is that the burden of reconstructing burnt down schools squarely lies on their parents,” he said. The Ministry of Education has said it will not fund or reconstruct schools that have been burnt down. Instead, parents will pay for reconstruction. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has warned that culprits will not only be treated as criminals, and their actions will reflect in their certificate of good conduct. Some of the reasons that have been cited for the unrest include national exam phobia, indiscipline, delocalisation of school heads and the school’s management iron fist approach in the running of schools.
