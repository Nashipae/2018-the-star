Todonyang chief Ekal Lochamin was on Tuesday shot dead by suspected Merille bandits from Ethiopia. Turkana North OCPD Francis Siror said the bandits were on a mission to steal cattle when they killed the chief at Lowareng'ak. "Lochamin was riding his motorbike to Lowareng'ak for a peace mission in Turkana North," Siror said. He was shot on the head several times, the police boss said adding that the assailants escaped after the incident. Siror said Lochamin has been the key campaigner for peace in Todanyang and had held many meetings for peaceful coexistence among the region's communities. On July 12, two fishermen were killed and six others injured at Todonyang during an ambush at the Kenya-Ethiopia border. Siror urged residents to remain calm as police officers together with neighbouring security personnel pursue the culprits. Click here for the latest political news
