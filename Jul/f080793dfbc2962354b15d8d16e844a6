A train ferrying petrol derailed at Kibarani, Mombasa county, causing major traffic jams on roads in the area. One wagon fell into the Indian Ocean and another on the road in the incident at about 4 am on Thursday. Kibarani-Makupa, the main feeder to Mombasa town, was closed as workers cleared the wreckage while alternative routes through the Port of Mombasa and Mwakirunge dumping site were opened. Mombasa county police commander Johnstone Ipara said the train was heading from Mombasa when it derailed at Bunda flyover. He said there were no casualties and that evacuations were on to mitigate disaster. Kenya Railways is yet to comment on the extent of damage or spillage. This is the second train accident at the same spot in two months. In May, a train spilled petrol after it went off the tracks. The scene was cordoned off to avoid an explosion. Concerns have been raised about the transport challenges posed by the causeway in the event of an accident. The available alternative routes are long and some are in pathetic condition.
