Two matatu touts who allegedly caused the death of a student on the Thika Superhighway were charged with murder yesterday. Amos Mwangi and Alex Musyoka are said to have pushed Doreen Mwiti, 21, out of a moving matatu on June 13 near Safari Park Hotel. They did not take a plea after the court heard that Musyoka did not have a lawyer to represent him. High Court Judge James Wakiaga directed that the accused be provided with a lawyer. The case will be mentioned on July 19, when the two are expected to plead to the charges. Mwiti was buried on June 23 in Ndamene village, Imenti.

Some city residents said impounding matatus whose operators commit such crimes was not enough. They demanded the deregistration of the sacco. Dickson Mbugua of the Matatu Welfare Association had demanded that the culprits be brought to book so  justice is served. “It’s wrong and brutal for crew members to mistreat their clients. This is the fourth incident. It’s unfortunate that it’s becoming a trend,” he told the Star on the phone. “We’re not going to condone such behaviour because it violates the road safety code.” Read: Family mourns girl pushed from matatu Click here for
