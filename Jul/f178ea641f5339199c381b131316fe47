Heated politics on 2022 elections may derail President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four Agenda, Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has said. Lusaka asked leaders to stop much politics and confrontations that threaten national unity and stability. He said the excessive politicking in the country overshadowing matters to do with development. "We need to slow down and focus on the Big Four Agenda to enable the country to prosper economically," Lusaka said. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto need support to steer the country but not too much politics. "Too much politics is not good for local and foreign investors and besides, it will undermine President Uhuru’s legacy ahead of his exit from office in 2022," Lusaka said. He was speaking in Nandi County during a funds drive in aid of the Catholic Church on Sunday. “For the Jubilee government to implement the big four agenda we must reduce politics and focus on issues affecting Kenyans," he said. Lusaka said it was not wise for a section of leaders to keep on dragging the President into their petty politics. He also wants investigation agencies to deal with corruption in counties instead of focusing on national government only. Click here for the latest political news
