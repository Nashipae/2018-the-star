The Land and Physical Planning ministry will partner with counties to reclaim grabbed public land, CS Faridah Karoney said in Nakuru yesterday. They parcels include those set aside for schools and settlement schemes. Karoney said the ministry is committed to ensuring proper land ownership. It will verify and issue title deeds, she said. Karoney said the ministry is cleaning up and digitising land records as part of its war on corruption. They target to complete 18 registries by the end of June next year. Staff shuffling is also ongoing. The CS said this will provide a lasting solution to land conflicts across the country. She cited Rongai, Gilgil, Bahati, Naivasha and Molo — all in Nakuru county. “The issues of land and land ownership can’t be resolved by the Lands Ministry alone. That’s why we’ve begun engaging stakeholders — among them county governments and the political leaders,” she said.
