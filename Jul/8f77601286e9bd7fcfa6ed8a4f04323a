Khalid Sheikh Salim also referred as Sheikh Khalid Balala has been awarded Sh6
million in compensation for violation of his right to Kenyan citizenship. Mombasa High Court judge Erick Ogola directed that Khalid be
compensated for the mental torture he underwent when he was stripped
off his citizenship and forced to seek refugee in Germany. Khalid was charged with treason in 1992. He was denied bail and incarcerated at the Shimo La Tewa and Manyani prisons. He was later acquitted. His passport was confiscated by embassy officials while on a trip to Germany. He stayed in exile for four years. Ogola said the experience might not
have been physical torture but the psychiatric aspect of the torture
might have been more traumatising. “The petitioner was forced to seek
refugee in a foreign country for four years. That is enough reason to
have the state compensate him for the troubles he underwent,” Ogola
said. Khalid wanted to be paid Sh200 million. But Ogola said he did not prove why should be awarded the amount.
