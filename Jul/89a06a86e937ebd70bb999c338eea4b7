Kenyan musician Zikki has released a new jam called Kamata, featuring celebrated reggae musician Tarrus Riley. The video is sure to win the hearts of his fans, blending East African and Jamaican cultures. So, how did the two met? "I had travelled out of the country to do my album in Dominican Republic, but we sort of like rerouted and had to go to Jamaica," Zikki said. "So when we were there, my manager called someone from there and told them that we wanted to record a dupebox. We went there and they heard my demos. "To my surprise, they said I was too talented and they even chose the song 'Kamata', and asked me if I would allow Tarrus to put in a verse in the song, and I was so amazed, I could not believe that. "They called Tarrus and it happened. I feel that it is my talent that got me Tarrus." Zikki said working with Tarrus was one of his best experiences ever. "It was humbling working with him. Despite the fact that he is known for his music, he is very humble and down to earth. I feel it is a blessing," he said. "We are planning for him to come to Kenya and get a concert together, because I have another song with him that will be in his album." 'Kamata' is a feel-good song that is just simple, and we want to make people feel free about life. Zikki is better known for his song with Jaguar, Take it slow. He said they are good friends, thanking him for opening his world of music. "I still talk with Jaguar, and our relationship is good. Given an opportunity, I would do more songs with him. He is like a father to me because he opened my world up to so many possibilities."
