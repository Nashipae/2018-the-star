A Ugandan court on Thursday validated constitutional changes that removed the 75-year presidential age limit. The ruling could potentially allow President Yoweri Museveni to extend his three-decade rule. Three of the five judges endorsed the Ugandan Parliament decision, in December last year, to scrap the age cap that drew criticism for opposition parties that the 73-year old Museveni wanted to be President for life. "The removal of age limit may encourage an incumbent to wish to keep himself in office perpetually but the citizens still retain the power to either return the same president or elect a different one," said Elizabeth Musoke, one of the three judges who endorsed the amendment. Museveni's 32-year rule has been punctuated by corruption scandals, human rights violations and poor social services. He is the latest in a string of African leaders who have tried to prolong their the time in office. In Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and SouthÂ Sudan, such moves have provoked instability.
