A Makadara court yesterday found four teens guilty of sexually assaulting a doctor in Eastleigh using a metal rod. They were also found guilty of abducting and attempting to rape the doctor — the wife of a senior government official on July 14, 2016. Chief magistrate Heston Nyaga said the teenagers were guilty of abduction, while in the sexual assault and attempted rape charges, two of them were principal offenders. “The complainant’s testimony was credible and without contradictions. She told court the truth by identifying the four accused persons and not linking them with three others who were freed for lack of evidence,” he said. The four had been charged alongside three others who were acquitted as the prosecution failed to prove they were involved. “I hereby find the second and third accused as aiders and abetters of the sexual assault and attempted rape offences,” Nyaga said. He however acquitted the four on a robbery with violence charge, citing lack of enough evidence by the prosecution. He said the prosecution did not come out clearly and the offence “was not demonstrated well”. “The intention of the accused persons was to intimidate the complainant and have her move out of Eastleigh,” Nyaga said. The complainant had said the accused abducted her as she left her clinic in the city estate. She said they took control of her car and forced her into the back seat without saying a word.
