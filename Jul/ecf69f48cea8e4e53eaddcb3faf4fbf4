The World Bank will use Sh539 million to support pastoralists in 14 arid and semi-arid areas. Pastoralists who lost their herds to drought will be assisted to restock, Omar Bulle, a programmes officer at the bank, said yesterday. He said the project has already been rolled out in some counties targeting vulnerable groups. Bulle spoke in Wajir East constituency. The groups covered in the project include the aged, single-parent households, orphans, widows and people living with disability. “This is an exercise that will be carried out in a very honest and transparent manner. There will be no shortcuts or favouritism. I want to forewarn anyone who wants to do some monkey business to keep away,” Bulle said. Mohamed Guley from Habaswein, Wajir South, a beneficiary of the programme who had lost all his animals, could not hide his joy as he drove away his 10 goats. “Our father did not take us to school. We do not have any formal education or skill apart from pastoralism. One of my siblings is in school. So, you can imagine how difficult it is for us to survive when we have lost all animals,” he said. The father of eight said he would provide for his family from the sale of goat milk. Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi commended the World Bank, saying the programme would alleviate poverty. “I appeal to the beneficiaries to make good use of the opportunity presented to them and restock,” he said. Abdi urged parents to stop denying children the right to education.
