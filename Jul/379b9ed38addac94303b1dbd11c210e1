A family from Khachonge village, Kabuchai constituency, Bungoma county, is seeking justice from the state for their daughter killed in Dubai. The family of Mary Wanyonyi, 27, said they received a call on July 19, requesting them to go to the Foreign Affairs office. There they were notified of Wanyonyi’s death.

They found her dead in the bathroom.” The family asked for the body so they could have a postmortem carried out. Wanyonyi’s body was flown to Kisumu Airport. A postmortem at Oginga Odinga Referral Hospital revealed she died after she was hit by a blunt object on the head. Wabomba said, “As a family, we believe her death was not natural.” Wanyonyi’s mother Gertrude said her daughter completed Form 4 and opted to go to Dubai. She worked with a friend who linked her to agents. Wanyonyi was looking for money to further her studies.  Gertrude told journalists at their home that Wanyonyi was a responsible girl and would send her money every month. “Now my daughter is no more. I don’t know what to do to get justice. If she was killed, those responsible should be arrested for taking her life.” Her father Peter Wanyonyi said she was her fifth child and was just about to return to Kenya after working in Dubai for four years.
