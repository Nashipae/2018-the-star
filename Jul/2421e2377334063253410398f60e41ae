Kenya imported more goods than its exports in the first quarter of 2018, latest trade figures shows. Data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows the total value of imports went up by 3.7 per cent to Sh438.5 billion from Sh422.7 billion recorded within a similar period in 2017. According to the bureau, the increased imports was on account of increased expenditure on imports of petroleum products, iron and steel and road motor vehicles. On the flip-side, exports recorded a 7.2 per cent increase to Sh161.7 billion within the first three months of the year. This was attributed to increased export earnings from tea, horticultural products and; titanium ores and concentrates whose export values went up by 12.5, 15.7 and 34.5 per cent respectively. A comparison of the two; imports and exports shows that Kenyaâ€™s balance of trade is still heavily in favour of its trading partners. Asia remained the leading source of imports during the quarter under review despite a five per cent decline in the value of imports from the region which amounted to Sh279 billion. Ironically, Imports from China decreased by 22.3 per cent to record Sh88.3 billion in value down from Sh113.6 billion, a decline in exports to China was also witnessed during the first quarter with Kenya exporting goods worth Sh1.63 billion, a drop from Sh2.51 billion exported in 2017. Imports from Indonesia also went down by 32 per to Sh10.8 billion. ECONOMY EXPANDS Tea, Horticulture, salt and unroasted coffee remained Kenyas top exports to its bilateral partners, while industry machinery, petroleum products,iron and steel were found to be the most imported goods. Africa accounted for 13.2 per cent of the total imports which rose by nearly 40 per cent during the review period to Sh58 billion.Ongoing trade wrangles between Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania did not block imports from Uganda as they more than doubled from Sh 6.8 billion in the first quarter of 2017 to Sh16.8 billion in the same quarter of 2018. Imports from Europe and America also went up by 7.29 and 21.5 per cent to record Sh65.11 billion and Sh34.12 billion respectively. While Kenya bought more goods from African nations, total exports to the region declined by 7.4 per cent from Sh8.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017 to Sh54.0 billion in the same quarter of 2018. This was attributed to decline in the value of total exports to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and East African Community member states. Total exports to America exhibited a similar trend with exports to the United States of America and Canada recording declines of 14.7 per cent and 62.9 per cent to Sh9.3 billion and Sh0.4 billion, respectively, over the same period. Despite the unfavorable balance of trade, the economy expanded at a rate of 5.7 percent compared with 4.8 percent in the same period of last year. The significant acceleration in growth was mainly attributable to improved weather conditions and a boost in business and consumer confidence after the conclusion of general elections in 2017.
