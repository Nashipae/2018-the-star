The tax collector is struggling to recover Sh158 billion tax in arrears. Kenya Revenue Authority commissioner of domestic taxes Benson Korongo said out of the amount, Sh90 billion forms part of the penalties and interest. Karongo told the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi Sh15.8 billion is from disputes lodged by taxpayers. “A good proportion of the money is attributed to pending disputes, penalties and interests. There are many disputes pending in courts, tax tribunals and our alternative dispute resolution mechanisms,” Korongo said. Wandayi raised concerns whether KRA would recover the money. “Despite the lengthy explanation you have given, are we likely to get this money? If at all we can get it, how much and when?” he asked. Korongo said they have established systems to seal tax loss loopholes. "We have been conducting proper monitoring of each taxpayer’s account. When taxpayers fail to file tax returns, assessments are issued and such individuals are detected by the system," he said. KRA had a tax target of Sh1.5 trillion in the previous financial year that ended on June 30. In 10 months it had collected Sh989 billion and was unlikely to meet the target in the remaining two months. The full year collection figure is yet to be released. The Tax Procedures Act 2015 prescribes a Sh20,000 penalty for any individual income tax return filed after the June 30 deadline and an interest of one per cent of the tax due. Employers and employees would have extra time to file tax returns without any penalty if MPs pass the Finance Bill 2018. Kenya Revenue Auhority domestic tax assistant manager Jeremiah Kinyua last month said the proposed change would repeal Section 25 of the Tax Procedures Act 2015 and replace it with the new provisions.
