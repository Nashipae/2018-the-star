Some cases of unrest have resulted from poor management of schools, Education CS Amina Mohamed has said, partly shifting blame from parents. Earlier remarks by ministry officials suggested that parents needed to instill discipline at home and that the learners were panicking ahead of the national examinations.

boards are the supervisory bodies so they should be able to pick up early warning signs. I think they
have the really big responsibility of warning and engaging the ministry on ways
to address situations before they erupt." In May,
Amina instructed school boards to conduct security
assessments and compile reports but some are yet to. This followed cases of arson and riots at institutions across the country. Sixty three have been affected so far. The Cabinet Secretary said the ministry asked education coordinators in all counties to compile reports on reasons for the chaos mainly during
the second term. Speaking in Nairobi on Wednesday, Amina said the ministry's action will follow reports from six remaining counties. "We hope those yet to submit their reports will do so before the end of the term so the ministry takes action [based on] recommendations during the August holiday," she said. She spoke at Kenya Education Management Institute (KEMI) during the inauguration of
its council and launch of a training for the Board of Management, which drew participants from six counties. Read: Kenya Power not the scapegoat, Lamu boss says on school fires Also read: Expert comment: What Amina said about school fires Click here for the latest political news
