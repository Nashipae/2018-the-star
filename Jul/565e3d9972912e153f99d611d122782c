Nairobi woman representative Esther Passaris was on Thursday chased by rowdy youths in Tassia after they stormed a meeting she had convened in the area. Four people were injured during the chaos at Tassia grounds. It took the intervention of Embakasi East MP Babu Owino to calm the charged youths. Passaris said they met Babu at the gate while she was fleeing from the youths who had knives. “Babu met us escaping from the meeting but insisted on us returning citing that the youth are our children. He talked to them and we went back and continued with the meeting,” Passaris said. She said police worsened the situation when they lobbied tear-gas at the meeting. Passaris had called the meeting courtesy of The National Government Affirmative Action Fund to educate youth and women on financial issues and on how they can access the Youth Fund.

Babu asked the youths to seek help on how to engage more in productive and development-oriented activities instead of being paid peanuts by malicious politicians to cause violence. “It is important for our youths to learn from the past experience. We all know that violence helps no one and it is sad that we still have some people out there who believe that giving the 100 shillings to cause fights in meetings will solve the unemployment problem in this country,” Babu said.
