The two Cuban doctors posted to Lamu county began work yesterday at King Fahad Hospital on Lamu Island. An orthopaedic surgeon and a physician were assigned houses in  the hospital’s staff quarters when they arrived on Sunday. County Medical Services chief officer Abubakar Badawy said the two have joined more than 500 staff. “We’re looking forward to a better team and improved medical services,” he said. Badawy said the expats will visit all hospitals on a rotating basis to ensure their expertise benefits all residents. He urged medical personnel to cooperate and offer better services to the people of Lamu, calling it the dawn of an era in the healthcare sector. The Lamu County Referral Hospital boss Ahmed Farid thanked the national government for posting the two specialists. He said the move will improve services and reduce referrals. “We trust that with this reinforcements of quality expertise, referral cases will reduce and the cost of care will go down. For decades, we have had to refer orthopaedic cases all the way to Mombasa,” he said. “Now diagnosis of diseases like diabetes, hypertension and cancer will be done locally by the physician.” Farid said local medics will benefit while interacting with the Cubans in the course of their work.  He said they have a wealth of experience and expertise that is needed to transform healthcare. “We look forward to working together with the new members of the team to improve standards of medical care here,” he said.
