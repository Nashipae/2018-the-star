The Judicial Service Commission yesterday won big after the High Court ruled that the salaries agency overstepped its mandate when it capped the JSC’s monthly meetings.Justice Chacha Mwita ruled that the decision by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) capping the JSC’s sittings to eight in a month was unlawful. Read: JSC protests against capping of its sittings to eightThe judge said the SRC is only mandated to set salaries of state officers and purporting to direct the JSC on how to conduct its affairs amounted to interfering with its judicial independence.“The decision to cap number of sittings to eight was a violation of the Constitution, an order is hereby issued quashing SRC’s decision of December 19, 2015,” ruled Justice Mwita following an application by JSC.The JSC filed a lawsuit in 2016 challenging the SRC’s decision to cap its paid monthly meetings to not more than eight. This was after the salaries commission, in a circular, announced its decision, which it said was meant to prevent abuse.Secretary Anne Gitau, in a letter dated July 27, 2016, said some members of the commission drew sitting allowances for meetings that were not properly constituted. “The petitioner’s members got huge allowances from unchecked and unlimited number of sittings,” she said. However, the JSC, in a suit filed against SRC and the Attorney General, argued that the move was unconstitutional and interfered with its administrative independence.The JSC said unless the decision was stopped, it would be unable to discharge its duties.“In seeking to limit sittings, the SRC has acted in violation of the JSC Act, which states that the commission can hold meetings as it deems necessary,” lawyer Isa Mansur argued. He said financial autonomy was a key pillar for all independent commissions and the JSC must, therefore, be allowed to carry out its functions without interference.Mansur argued that the SRC acted beyond its mandate and assumed powers meant for Parliament. It was the role of the National Assembly to allocate funds to independent commissions, he said. The salaries commission, however, defended its directive. It said if the JSC had its way, there would be an unnecessary increase in the wage bill to unsustainable levels.The agency had also argued that it had the mandate to settle the sitting allowances of the JSC members just like for other state officers, and capping their sittings was necessary.But the court ruled that the role of the JSC is limited to reviewing and setting remuneration of state officers.“An order of prohibition is hereby issued to the respondent from interfering with the mandate of the petitioner,” justice Mwita said.
