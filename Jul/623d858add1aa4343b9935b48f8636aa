My vehicle stopped suddenly near the Kingfisher picnic site. In front of me, a moving mass snaked its way across the road. A closer inspection revealed millions of red army ants ( known as siafu in Kiswahili). It was fascinating to watch their deliberate aggressive advance. They can consume almost any form of living protein in their advance path. The advance of the siafu army with millions of ants is slow but sure, allowing larger faster species to escape, while slower or injured species become prey. This sighting triggered memories of an event that happened to our family many years ago in Kibali forest, Uganda. In early evening darkness, we walked into a very large mass of army ants in our path, I realised immediately what had happened and shouted, “RUN!”. Even though we moved with record speeds many ants still managed to bite us. The result was an “ant dance” that would have won any dance competition, and having to partly remove clothing to get rid of them, as they do not let go easily. There are 60 species of army ants in the genus Dorylus, mostly found in Central and East Africa. A single colony can contain over 20 million ants. They are completely blind and rely on pheromones to communicate. They serve good purpose in nature by cleaning any dead matter or pests and vermin from an area, including in human homes. The masai allow siafu to move through their homes as they clean out any vermin like rats and cockroaches, and the masai still use the large pincer jaws as stitches to close their bush wounds. Yes, God has created many wonders, and the Siafu Army is one of them.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00. For more information, visit www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.
