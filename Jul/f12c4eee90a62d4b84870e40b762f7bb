Nutrition status of children under five years in Turkana, Marsabit and Tana River has improved due to higher milk consumption, the National Drought Management Authority has said. Garissa, Mandera, West Pokot, Narok, Baringo, Laikipia, Tharaka Nithi are also on a stable trend. In its recent National Drought Early Warning Bulletin, NDMA said improvement was attributed to higher milk consumption in pastoral counties and improved dietary diversity due to availability of green vegetables and pulses (annual crops) in the marginal agricultural counties. Deterioration in nutrition status of children under 5 years was however observed in Samburu, Lamu and Meru. In Samburu, the proportion of sampled children under 5 years at risk of being malnourished increased from 19.5 percent in April to 21.8 in May which was associated with a rise in cases of diarrhea in children as a result of contamination of water sources due to floods. In Lamu, the average Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measurement MUAC rate increased to 5.3 percent in May from 5.0 percent recorded in April. The increase according to the bulletin was attributed to low milk availability and consumption.
