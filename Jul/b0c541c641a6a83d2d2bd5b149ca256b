Street girls and women who have been suffering quietly during their menses have gotten a reprieve albeit temporarily. Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris on Wednesday visited some of them in Majengo and offered 200 packets of sanitary pads. Speaking to the Star, Passaris challenged the government to come up with a special kitty for the street families. “I do not have an allocation to supply sanitary towels to the street children, my kitty is only Sh7 million and it's exhausted," Passaris said. She said no data is available for the number of women and adolescents on the streets to advise on proper planning. The government has launched a countrywide supply of sanitary pads to public schools. The women narrated the suffering they undergo every month, saying they are forced to use old and dirty mattresses. "The hard time is when periods come as the pain is unbearable. Most times we use rags and old mattresses," a street woman only identified as Tabby said. Veronica Wambui, who has lived in the streets since 2016, said she uses a cheap sanitary pad but when she's broke, she uses old rags and mattresses.
