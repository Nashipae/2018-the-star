This article will focus
on the possibility of a state’s highest officers being prosecuted for crimes,
not whether they can be sued in civil actions (like breach of a contract). As commentators have
observed, the President has protection against being prosecuted for any crime
when in office. The same is not true of the Deputy President or governors.  WHAT HAPPENS ELSEWHERE? I must admit the
Constitution of Nigeria does give immunity to the President, Vice President and
governors. The Nigerian Senate in 2016 tried to remove this in the case of “criminal
proceedings connected to, related to or arising from economic and financial
crimes”, but apparently this did not pass. The best known systems
with two levels of government, usually called federations, are the US, Canada,
Australia, Germany, Malaysia, India and Brazil. Governors head American states
and they can be prosecuted. Whether the President can be prosecuted is a
surprisingly controversial issue. Brazil, like the US, has
a presidential system of government. The President can be charged as President Michel
Temer was last year. However, this must be approved by a large majority of Parliament
(but President Temer’s prosecution was not). For ordinary crimes, presidents
cannot be arrested. State governors may be tried, though by a higher court than
other people.  PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEMS The other major federal
countries have parliamentary systems of government. These have much less
deferential attitudes towards their heads of government, the Prime Minister,
and to the heads of government of the states or provinces that form their
second tiers of government. There is no legal
obstacle to even the prime ministers of India, Canada, Australia or Malaysia
being prosecuted for a crime. (Indeed there was some talk of prosecuting Justin
Trudeau of Canada recently.) Clearly, the same is true of the heads of the
lower level governments, premier or chief ministers, as they may be called. The President of India
(an almost entirely ceremonial post, with functions that must be carried out in
accordance with the instructions of the Prime Minister), cannot be prosecuted
for any criminal charge while in office. The same is true of state governors (a
bit like the President but at the state level). The Malaysian Prime
Minister also has no immunity. But the head of state (usually a traditional ruler
(sultan) of a state serving as national head of state in rotation) can be
charged only in a special court and with the approval of the Attorney General.
And the position is similar for the sultans when not taking a turn as national
head of state. Until 1993, these rulers had greater immunity. Readers may recall that
a South African court held that it was irrational not to prosecute President
Jacob Zuma. In other words, the true
head of government in parliamentary systems is usually not protected from being
taken to court for a suspected crime just like any other person. It is not
clear that the Prime Minister of Israel will not be prosecuted soon. In parliamentary
systems, the ceremonial head of state often has some protection from criminal
prosecutions (only while in office). In presidential systems,
it is more common for the head of government (who is also the head of state) to
have considerable protection while in office.  BUT WHY DO
PRESIDENTS HAVE SPECIAL PROTECTION? In the mid-nineteenth
century an English economist wrote a book in which he distinguished between
what he called “the dignified parts” of the British constitution, “which excite
and preserve the reverence of the population” and “the efficient parts”, “by
which it, in fact, works.” The first part is the Queen and associated ceremonies
and institutions, and the Prime Minister heads the second. As a law student in
England, I learned “The Queen can do no wrong”. This does not mean what it says
literally: It means she cannot be held legally liable. It was explained on the
basis that the courts were always conceived as the monarch’s courts, and how
can the monarch be hauled before his or her own courts? At that time, even the
government (which was Her Majesty’s after all) was quite hard to sue, but this
has greatly improved. But still you can’t sue the Queen and she cannot be
prosecuted. Other European monarchs also have similar immunity. The framers of the
American constitution adopted the immunity rule for their presidentâ€•a
democratic alternative to a monarch. I am not sure why any
president, whether purely (or largely) ceremonial or an executive president,
should have any greater protection from prosecution than a prime minister. If
the person doing the real job â€• being the head of government â€• in the
parliamentary systems of the world can be prosecuted for crimes, whether
committed in official or personal capacity, why cannot the person heading the
“dignified parts” of government equally be liable?  BUT PRESIDENTS DON’T
ESCAPE SCOT-FREE One argument for
assuming the US presidents cannot be prosecuted in the ordinary way is because
there is a special procedure, impeachment: The House of Representatives can
prosecute the president before the Senate, which may lead to removal. The
problem about this is that it is a very political process. There is a degree of
political division and viciousness in the US currently that makes some US
commentators believe the idea that President Donald Trump could be prosecuted
in the ordinary way is unacceptable. But the same factors also make it most
unlikely that the House of Representatives would impeach him. No such dispute can
arise in Kenya: It is clear the President can be impeached and cannot be prosecuted.
It is equally clear the Deputy President can be impeached and prosecuted. However,
our Constitution makes it most likely that the President will have the majority
support in Parliament — he is most unlikely to be impeached. By the way, prime
ministers can usually be removed by a political vote of no confidence (much
more easily than a President can be impeached) and they can be prosecuted.  RISK OF HARASSMENT BY
PROSECUTION? There is surely a risk
that the possibility of prosecution might be abused. Politically motivated
prosecutions are not unknown, even in Kenya. But if this is a serious
risk, why is immunity reserved, in parliamentary systems, for the less
political office holders, namely the monarchs and other heads of state? In the UK, there is the
possibility of private individuals bringing prosecutions. But such a
prosecution can be taken over and stopped by the Attorney General. In Kenya, it
is very hard for private prosecutions to be brought. Prosecutions are supposed
to be by the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is supposed to be impartial â€•
entirely non-political. This should make political prosecutions impossible.  CONCLUSION As far as governors are
concerned, not only does the Constitution not protect them from being
prosecuted for alleged crimes, but also there seems no justification for contemplating
for a moment a change in the law. Furthermore, most of their counterparts in
other countries do not have any such privilege. Real monarchies might
perhaps be thought to be in a special position, though many would doubt
it.  They cannot even be impeached â€• though
if a monarch was suspected of a serious crime, he or she would be under huge
pressure to abdicate, or there might be a revolution. But why does a monarch-like
aura cling to ceremonial presidents? There is something about
executive presidents, like ours, that makes then appear a bit like monarchs. Is
this not unhealthy in a modern democratic state? It also violates the idea of
equality before the law. Arguably it is an argument against the whole executive
presidential system.
