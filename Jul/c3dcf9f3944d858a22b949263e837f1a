Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong’i (pictured) plans to cater for medical expenses for widows below the age of 60 and their children. Tong’i yesterday said widows and their children suffer, especially when they fall sick. He said he will roll out the programme in January next year. The legislator spoke at St Vincent De Paul Nyanko Mixed Secondary School. He donated a school bus bought using CDF cash. Tong’i said good health will enable the widows to focus their energies on fending for their children. He said orphans in colleges and universities will be prioritised for the CDF bursaries. Tong’i warned learners against burning dormitories. He said their action will have dire consequences in their lives.
