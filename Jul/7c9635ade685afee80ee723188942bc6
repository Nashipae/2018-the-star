Macadamia farmers in Meru have petitioned the government to allow them to sell Macadamia nuts directly to Chinese brokers. The farmers filed their petition through lawyer Kiogora Mugambi. The farmers want the law that bans export of raw macadamia nuts expunged claiming the Agriculture minister misuses it. “The minister can give licences to few people to export raw macadamia at expense of small scale farmers,” Kiogora said. He said an association of packers, processors and traders oppose the petition and have asked to be allowed to file responses. Kiogora said Chinese brokers who buy Macadamia at good prices have been harrased and deported. The case will be heard on July 26. The farmers said the Chinese brokers buy one kilogramme Sh200 while local buyers buy at less than Sh100. Godfrey Kirema, a farmer, said the government should weed out cartels who have invaded the market and led to deportation of chinese buyers. Mercy Kendi said they want Chinese buyers back as they were buying at good prices. Former Agricultire Principal Secretary Richard Lesiyampe recently said the government discourages the export of raw nuts because to develop the local industry. “You cannot just come from nowhere because the prices are good and start collecting nuts,” he said two years ago. “Companies are investing huge amounts of money in setting up processing plants and here we have brokers or middlemen who want to reap where they did not plant. The government will not allow it.” Embu county already has a macadamia factory.
