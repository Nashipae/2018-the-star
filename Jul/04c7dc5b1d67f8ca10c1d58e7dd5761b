The order stopping the government from impounding gaming machines, pending the hearing of a case filed by over 500 business people, has been extended. Justice Wilfrida Okwany extended the order on Monday after the owners told the court that the government's intensified crackdown had affected their businesses. Through lawyer Kibe Mungai, the gaming machine operators said the clampdown has intensified in the last three months despite the order. Mungai noted that more than 2,700 gaming and betting machines have been confiscated and others destroyed. "Monies contained in the machines have been stolen, contrary to the orders of the court," he said. The suit was filed by Samuel Kahiu and 549 others against regional commissioners, county commissioners and their subordinates. Kahiu noted that they have adhered to all regulations and operating legally. He denied the allegation that the machines are a danger to national security as gambling is constitutional.

However, the businessmen say more operators have been arrested and arraigned following a directive by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i. The operators further argue that the machines are their main sources of income. They also say that the Betting Act enacted in 1966 cannot apply, considering the 2010 Constitution, because counties are now empowered to issue licences. Justice Okwany directed Mungai to file his submissions before July 8. More on this: I’m targeted in anti-gambling war, says gaming society boss Click here for the latest political news
