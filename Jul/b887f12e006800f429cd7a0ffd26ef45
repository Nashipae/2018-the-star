( 2008 ) and being completely taken by surprise. Having never been a fan of musicals, I went into the cinema expecting a different outcome. But to date, I remember how the film was so engaging that the whole audience was singing, clapping and dancing to Abba’s renditions. Perhaps the charm is with the music or with the cast, but whatever charm the first film had, the magic is still alive in the sequel. Five years after the events of the first film transpired, Donna’s daughter Sophie is left carrying the heavy burden of fulfilling her mother’s dream of reopening her hotel. With Donna’s death still fresh in their lives, Sam and Sophie are having a hard time coping with the present. Meanwhile, in the past, a young Donna meets the delightful and attractive Harry in Paris. Harry’s charms work on Donna and he manages to take her virginity. Donna misses her boat to Kalokairi, but she is offered a ride by another young man named Bill. While on the island, Donna meets Sam and they have a whirlwind romance, until Donna discovers Sam has a fiancée. Sophie uses the stories she learns about her mother’s past as strength to deal with her troubles. The film goes back and forth in time to capture the essence of forging relationships and how relationships made in the past can have a lasting impact on people’s lives. The film is just as good (if not better) than its 10-year-old predecessor. It has light, musical vibes that make the audience feel as though they are at a concert and they want to sing and dance along to the music!  Star Rating: 4/5
