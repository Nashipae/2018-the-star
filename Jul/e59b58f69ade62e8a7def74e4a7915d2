Kenya Airways has been dragged to court by an Angolan firm over an alleged $6million (Sh600 million) ticket scam by two of its employees. A Luanda based daily newspaper, Valor, reported that KQ has been been taken to court by Belchix, its ticket selling agency, on claims that the airline engaged in a counterfeit ticket scheme billed to the agency. The airline’s head office in Nairobi yesterday confirmed knowledge of the case but declined to comment, citing sub judice. “That is a court matter, I cannot comment,’’ said chief commercial officer Vincent Coste. Chairperson Michael Joseph denied knowledge of the case. declined to pay According to the newspaper, KQ’s relationship with Belchix turned sour in 2015 when the airline submitted an invoice of $6 million to the agency for outstanding ticket sales. The agency declined to pay after an internal audit established that KQ’s officials in the country had a parallel centre that issued fake tickets but which were charged to the agency. The audit named KQ’s former regional director for Africa Rosemary Adogo and her assistant Caroline Dunask for leading a parallel ticketing process without the knowledge of the agency which had exclusive rights to do so. heard in camera The two are said to have used the names of Suzana Pindali and Ricardo Viera, former accountants of Belchix to allegedly forge deposits and other classified documents. The paper reported that the case which was heard in camera before Judge Elisa Range mid last month was postponed for five days to pave way for an independent audit. The judge ordered the fresh audit after hearing testimonies from parties involved. KQ launched two weekly flights to Luanda in August 2010 after obtaining landing rights from the Angolan government. The then chief executive Titus Naikuni named Belchix as its representative in the new market. The flight is operated as a code share with TAAG Angolan Airlines.
