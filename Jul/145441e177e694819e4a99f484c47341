The reclamation of riparian land at Kibarani dumpsite, Mombasa, has been stopped forthwith and "massive corruption" cited as a driver. The National Assembly Committee on Environment has asked CS Koriako Tobiko to oversee the orders. "Tobiko will be held personally liable if reclamation continues," chairman Kareke Mbiuki said during a tour of the site on Monday. UNESCO has warned that Mombasa won't be an Island if the trend goes on; only 100 meters of sea remains. WARMA and NEMA stopped the reclamation but the orders have been violated. "We have invited the Director of Public Prosecution and Directorate of Criminal Investigation to visit this site and see the highest level of corruption and impunity that is taking place," Mbiuki said. "This is a precursor of land grabbing," he added. Mbiuki further said the National Land Commission should stateÂ whether the land is public or private as eight acres of the sea have been claimed. Mombasa county has said the dumpsite will be closed as the trash is killing aquatic life but the proposed site - Mwakirunge - is a flight path. In addition, a container freight station has been built on already reclaimed land. "We fear high-rise buildings will be set up," the chairman said. Kisumu Woman Representative Rosa Buyu added:"If a new site has been found, why are they still pushing solid waste into the ocean?" The committee has asked the NLC, Mombasa Cement, Kenya Ports Authority and Multiple Hauliers to appear before them on August 9 to explain the matter.
