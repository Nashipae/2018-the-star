Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has won an appeal case challenging nullification of his election by the high court. Making the ruling on Wednesday, Judge Erastus Githinji on behalf of the appeal judges said there was no evidence that Keter campaigned outside the stipulated time. On Tuesday, his lawyers led by Otiende Omollo told the appeal bench in Eldoret that High Court judge Kanyi Kimondo erred in law by nullifying the election based on evidence that was not factual. The High Court used one ground that Keter campaigned in six places, but we have argued that there was no evidence to that effect,‚Äù said Otiende while giving his submission before the judges.
