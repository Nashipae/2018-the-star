Two dormitories went up in flames in two Homa Bay secondary schools on Sunday. Some 70 students in Simbi Mixed in Karachuonyo and 20 in Ratang’a Boys High in Ndhiwa lost all their belongings. There was no unrest in the schools. In Simbi, the learners were watching the World Cup final match pitting France against Croatia at the time of the fire. The management said they had yet to establish the cause. The school has a population of 430, including 110 girls. “We don’t know what caused the fire because it occurred when most students were busy watching the World Cup final tournament,” deputy principal Moses Abila said. The Ratang’a dorm fire started at around 7.30pm. It destroyed books, bedding and other personal items. The value of the damage had not been established. Homa Bay Police Commander Marius Tum yesterday said they had launched investigations. “Ratang’a becomes the fifth school affected by fire. My officers are on the ground investigating the cause,” he said. Other schools are Oriwo Boys’ High, Kandiege Mixed and Gendia Boys’ High — all in Karachuonyo constituency. Last week, regional police commander Leonard Katana told the boards of management, teachers and parents that they have a responsibility to protect schools and stop destruction of property. He urged students to invest their time in studying. “The school administrations should effectively engage students so they understand them. These students are in stages of human development and if not well taken care of resort to unlawful acts,” Katana said.
