Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has urged politicians to respect state officers. He said on Saturday that politicians must stop behaviour that can cause tension. “I’m a public servant. I must defend my colleagues. I was so hurt by elected leaders who humiliated a county commissioner recently in Nakuru. The action was totally unfair,” Matiang’i said during a fundraiser at Sironga SDA Church in Nyamira. Politicians and residents heckled the Nakuru county commissioner at a public gathering. “It really hurts when elected leaders, who should be an example to the public, humiliate national officials. The Constitution should be respected. We should all abide by the law,” Matiang’i said. He urged MPs, senators, woman representatives and MCAs to use the right channels to solve their problems. “We all know the procedures for handling a misunderstanding. If there is a problem we need to follow the right procedures and solve it. Only angels don’t ere,” the Cabinet secretary said. He said the politicians embarrassed Kenya by stooping so low. Heckling a county commissioner addressing a gathering violates African norms, which require all leaders respected, he said. “How can you tell a county commissioner ‘shut up and shame on you’?” Matiang’i asked. The function was attended by Environment Principal Secretary Susan Mochache, Nyamira county commissioner Isaiah Nakoru, Woman Representative Jerusha Momanyi, Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose, Jimmy Angwenyi (Kitutu Chache North) and Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango). Also present were MPs Ben Momanyi (Borabu), Vincent Kemosi (West Mugirango), Samuel Arama (Nakuru Town West), Alfa Miruka (Bomachoge Chache), Richard Tongi (Nyaribari Chache) and Nyamira county assembly speaker Moffat Teya. Matiang’i earlier held a meeting with Nyamira MPs. He praised Gusii leaders for forging unity and respecting security and national government employees.
