Sirisia MP John Waluke has dismissed the handshake between Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula and Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa, terming it inconsequential. “I am still asking what crime they had done to each other. Isn’t this just stage-managed drama to gain political relevance?” he said. Waluke spoke in Sirisia. He said Wetang’ula “pushed” for the handshake to redeem his relevance after falling out with NASA leader Raila Odinga. He said Wetang’ula had shown signs he wanted to join Jubilee. “Let him just say he wanted to find a way of joining Jubilee and stop the theatrics about handshakes,” Waluke said. He told Wamalwa to be weary of Wetang’ula, adding he could “backstab” him once he settles in Jubilee. Nine-year rivalry Waluke questioned why “brothers” from the same community should “dramtise” their unity. He said Luhya unity cannot not be determined by two leaders. “The Luhya community is beyond Wetang’ula and Wamalwa. Let them not pretend they will decide the fate of Luhyas,” Waluke said. Through the Bukusu Mabanga Declaration, the two leaders agreed to work together to build peace and unity. The handshake was on Friday at Mabanga Farmers Training College in Bungoma. Wamalwa said it happened after long meetings. “My rivalry with Wetang’ula has lasted nine years since the era of the original Ford Kenya before it was split and each went his own direction. We have now mended fences and are working together,” he said. Wamalwa said the handshake was a milestone in achieving unity, which evaded them for almost a decade. Wetang’ula said, “We want to walk the talk. This signed agreement is an indication of good things. We want to walk together and we need to tell our people the truth; Eugene and I will showcase this soon.” Elders Wetang’ula praised the Bukusu Council of Elders for their efforts to bring him and Wamalwa together. “Our divisions led to the suffering of our people. That is the reason we are coming together,” he said.
