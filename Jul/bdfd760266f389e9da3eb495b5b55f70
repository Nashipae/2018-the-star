MPs’ love for foreign trips is a matter of national concern, Garissa elders have said. They were referring to the 20 MPs and senators who travelled to watch the World Cup final in Russia. “We are going through harsh economic times. Surely the MPs should have known better and travelled at their own expense not the taxpayer,” Kenya Livestock Council chairman Dubat Amey said. Addressing the press in Garissa town, he said the lawmakers use the trips to squander national resources. Hassan Osman said MPs and the National Assembly speaker should stop justifying the trip as “the more they talk about it the angrier Kenyans become”. But speaking in Garissa, National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale said the Sports committee will prepare a report to upon its return. “There is nothing out of order when a parliamentary Sports committee travels to watch a World Cup [match]. What is important is that they must file a report when they return for the House to discuss,” he said. “The report must, among other things, say what they have learnt, how that is important to the country and to the sector and the House in its wisdom will look at it and debate it.” The Star last week reported that 14 members of the National Assembly and six senators had travelled to Russia at the expense of the Kenya government. No Kenyan footballer was sponsored by the state to travel to Russia and Kenya continues to perform dismally in the Fifa rankings. Sports CS Rashid Achesa said officials from his ministry have not travelled to Russia.
