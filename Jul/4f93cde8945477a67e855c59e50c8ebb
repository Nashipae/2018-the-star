Police on Thursday arrested four suspects, including a woman, on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway in connection with Sim card swapping. The four were nabbed near Total petrol station in Naivasha. Police officers recovered tens of Sim cards, mobile phones and a laptop. The four were tracked from Nairobi. They were taken to Naivasha police station. A source said the suspects are accomplices of the three suspects who were arrested last week. “The four have been on the radar of detectives investigating Sim-swap and they were fleeing from Nairobi to Eldoret,” the source said. Witness Alex Wambugu said two police cars blocked the car ferrying the suspects. Naivasha DCIO Kennedy Njoroge said the four will be handed over to DCI officers in Nairobi, who are investigating the crime.
