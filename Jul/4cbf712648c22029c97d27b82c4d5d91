Nairobi backstreets could be turned into hawking zones if a new motion is passed by the county assembly. The motion sponsored by Zimmerman MCA Pius Mbono says backstreets have been underutilised. Mbono wants City Hall to rehabilitate the streets for use by hawkers. Mbono says the move will generate more revenues because the traders will be required to pay a fee to the county. The MCA has identified Aru lane, Gaberone lane, Taveta lane and those Kirinyaga and Lower Kirinyaga roads for rehabilitation. Mbono says hawkers can contribute to development if the sector is well-managed. He said frequent violent confrontations between askaris and hawkers have not solved challenges associated with the traders. "This assembly urges the executive to rehabilitate these streets and lanes and utilise them to provide space for street vendors," the motion reads. The motion wants hawkers to be allowed on the streets at least twice a week from 5:30pm.
