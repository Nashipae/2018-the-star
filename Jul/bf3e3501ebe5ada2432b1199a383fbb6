A body with wounds to the neck was found on a piece of idle land in Athi River, Machakos county, on Saturday morning. A woman reportedly noticed the body of Christopher Wambua while hanging clothes in the balcony of her house at Backyard apartments in Jua Kali slum. She alerted caretakers Anthony Munari and Sylvester Onsongo who reported the matter at Athi River police station under OB NO 10/14/07/2018. Residents said Wambua was a well known butcher who operated in Athi River town and that the murder was an isolated case. His body was found behind Sun Blaze Inn Bar and Restaurant along Athi River Mining Road. Police said the 36-year-old was killed inside the establishment and his body thrown over a fence. "[He suffered] neck injuries inflicted by a sharp object,” the police report stated. Athi River police boss Sharma Wario told the Star on phone that Wambua may have been murdered by a security guard he was seen with at the bar. “The information we have is that the bar’s watchman was seen last with the deceased. They were the last clients at the bar," he said. The bar maid left the two chewing miraa inside." Wario said they arrested four people, whom he identified as Julius Kioko, Faith Gathoni, Dominic Mutinda and Kyalo Kikuve, to help with investigations. “We are looking for someone we know,” he said and urged diplomacy, saying disagreements do no have to end in murder. Police took the body to Machakos Level Five Hospital mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
