 Police have been allowed to search the houses of two critics accused of posting abusive messages about prophet David Owuor. Milimani principal magistrate Ben Nzakyo allowed police to search
the houses of Kevin Kiriga and Paul Akhonya who are being investigated for abusing Owuor's followers. Nzakyo issued the search warrants
to constable Mohammed Amin two weeks ago. "It has been proved
to me on oath that for the purposes of investigations into the commission of an
offence, it is necessary to order PC Mohammed Amin to gain entry and search the
premises of Kevin Kiriga and Paul Akhonya for the purposes of collection of any
electronic computing devices that may have been used in committing the offense,"
the order reads. Amin said they are
investigating the two social media users for writing and uttering words with
intent to wound religious feelings. He said they received
a complaint from Julius Mulera on behalf of Owour on May 24. The abusive messages were posted on Facebook, YouTube and other social media sites. Police said the hateful videos and messages are
being circulated by Kiriga on Facebook and Akhonya on YouTube.  He had asked the court to issue the search warrants to allow
him access to their offices so that he can investigate and collect any
electronic computing devices that may have been used in circulating the alleged
hateful videos. The Prophet held a mega two-day crusade at Uhuru Park that
was graced by thousands of his supporters from across the country.
