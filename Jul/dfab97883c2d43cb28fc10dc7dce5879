The handshake between Migori Governor Okoth Obado and his political nemesis Ochillo Ayacko has sent political ripples across the county. On Monday during the burial of Migori Senator Ben Oluoch at Kanyimach Secondary School in Rongo constituency, ODM leader Raila Odinga asked the two leaders to shake hands in public. On Sunday and earlier during the day, there was tension among supporters of the leaders. The two were rivals during last year’s election. Rongo MP Paul Abuor tactfully urged Raila to initiate a peace and healing process similar to the one he had with President Uhuru Kenyatta. "Even in Rongo despite protracted campaigns, I had a handshake with former legislator Dalmas Otieno to bring peace," Abuor said. When he rose to speak, Raila said Migori county is an important political base. He asked the two leaders to go to the dias. “They should shake hands today,” he said. Ayacko said he will accept the move as what Raila has said. “Nobody can go against Baba. As you have spoken I will not go against that,” he said.
