 “Ð¡Ð¿Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð±Ð¾”
– This means thank you in Russian. It was the note left by the heartbroken
Japanese national football team in their locker room after they cleaned it
spotless. Not only
was the world stunned at this gesture, but also more astonishing was that they
did not have to do it, and particularly when they had been knocked out of the
World Cup at the eleventh hour. They did it anyway. And their devastated fans,
with teary eyes, cleaned up the bleachers. Japan had redefined sportsmanship
and selflessness. Meanwhile,
we have had our own share of evictions but with contrary endings. Boda boda
riders were evicted from operating in the Nairobi city centre in a bid to
decongest traffic and reduce accidents. Kibera residents residing on a road
reserve were this week evicted to pave way for a road construction; and Mau Forest
dwellers were evicted to protect East Africa’s single most important watershed
and lifeline for wildlife and the people. However,
unlike the genteel mannerisms displayed by the Japanese football team, our
evictees displayed coarse reactions of protest chaos, which were fueled by
human rights activists and politicians’ allegations of inhumane treatment.
These allegations sanitised the evictees and rebranded them from encroachers to
victims. Sadly, we
have become a nation of victims. We dodge collective responsibility and yell “haki yetu” each time we want to
exculpate ourselves from blame and project our faults and guilt onto others. We
pitch every legal attempt to reclaim public resources as a battle between good
and evil: Us against them. And this
is the tragedy of the commons. The commons is a public resource shared by many
individuals. No individual has a claim to any part of the resource, but rather
to the use of a portion of it for his or her own benefit. The tragedy is the
absence of regulation or abstinence of its enforcement, and consequently each
individual exploits the resource to their own advantage without limit. Benefits
accrue to a few encroachers, while the costs are spread among all other taxpayers.
Ultimately, the public resource is depleted and eventually ruined. The
context of our tragedy of commons is as follows. Data from the National Transport
and Safety Authority shows Nairobi has the highest number of motorcycle
fatalities. Just this year alone, 412 motorcyclists and their pillion
passengers have died and 702 injured. Last year, Nairobi bagged the prize of
being the third worst city in the world on traffic congestion. According to numbeo.com traffic index, Nairobi
residents spend an average of 62.60 minutes in traffic. This translates to
losing productivity of approximately Sh12 billion every month, according to the
World Bank. The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars estimates that
60 per cent of the water draining into Lake Victoria comes from the Mau Forest.
About 160 million people depend on River Nile for their livelihoods, whose
source is Lake Victoria. The question that begs is, should we protect a few at
the expense of the majority? A cottage
industry has emerged of a victimhood culture, where groups of people based on
carefully selected identity, demand to have their victimhood status recognised
and addressed. Politicians and human rights activists leverage this bandwagon
of victim politics because the appeal of identity politics undeniably commands
public attention and sympathy. Tragic news events drives public discourse which
keeps them in the limelight.  They
attribute a kind of superior virtue to those who claim to be victimised by
rallying emotive calls for reforms or restitutions for wrongs meted out on
them. Unfortunately, this quashes all debate and moral reasoning, and, in the
end, does little to resolve genuine oppression and suffering. But what
happened to protecting our social contract? Should human rights and voters might
trump morality and the respect of the rule of law? To live
harmoniously as a society, we abide by a social contract because life in the
state of nature is one of fear and selfishness and devoid of laws and
regulations. This makes it poor, short, nasty and brutish. This agreement means
people need to respect each other to make life tolerable. To do so, we tacitly
consent and surrender parts of our freedom to a governing authority. In return,
the governing authority protects our life, property and liberties through an
enforcement mechanism. Therefore, our liberties must be limited so that we
don’t hurt each other. I thus
make two submissions. One, the state
should apply the principle of the Golden Mean in their bid to reclaim public
resources. This tenet holds that good is to be found in a balance between
extremes because right thinking cannot occur in a state of deficiency or
excess. Therefore, in the ongoing evictions, the state should neither be cowed
from their intention, nor should they be reckless and use excessive force to
show their zeal. They should instead employ the virtue of courage, which is the
Golden Mean under these circumstances. Two,
self-appropriation of public resources increases the likelihood of neglect.
When people do not privately own a resource they are utilizing, they assume someone
else will take care of it instead of taking responsibility themselves. This
breeds constant strife and discord among its users. I, therefore, suggest that the
evictees should borrow a leaf from the Japanese football team and say thank you
- “Ð¡Ð¿Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð±Ð¾” - for the time that society has tolerated their habitation on what collectively
belongs to us by virtue of our social contract, and peacefully leave these
spaces tidier than they found them. My
unsolicited advice to the evictees, having problems does not make you noble or
virtuous. Like the rest of us, it makes you human, not victims. So do not set
the bar so low and give predatory institutions the power to continue victimising
you. By labelling you victims, they are flattering you. And flattery, like
chewing gum, is meant to be enjoyed for a short while, not swallowed.  Lies and victimhood make evil possible – Dennis
