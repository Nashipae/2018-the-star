Laikipia East security team has told boda boda riders to obey the law to reduce crime and accidents. Deputy county commissioner Esther Dhahabu said the committee resolved to limit the operating hours to 11pm. She spoke during a consultative meeting with the operators in Nanyuki town yesterday. “Criminals disguise themselves as boda boda riders at night and rob passengers,” Dhahabu said. Dhahabu urged the operators to observe traffic rules so as to reduce accidents during traffic jams. Separately, Deputy Governor John Mwaniki (pictured) said it was wrong for boda bodas to ferry four passengers on one bike.
