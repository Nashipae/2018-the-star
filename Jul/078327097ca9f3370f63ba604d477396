Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has ordered a fresh probe into a case in which a university student was killed in an accident involving a prisons officer. Kenyatta University student Maureen Wambui, 22, died on the morning of July 15 in a hit and run accident on Mombasa Road. She was from a party near Next-Gen Mall. Wambui’s boyfriend Dennis Baragu, who witnessed the crash, alleged Sergeant Dismas Motogwa Gitenge drove to South C with the body on the roof of his vehicle. He reportedly dumped the body and disappeared. Baragu said his girlfriend was one month pregnant with his baby. Baragu is not listed as a witness. The officer attached to Nairobi West Prison was identified using his vehicle's number plate. “The DPP is giving the matter due attention. Appropriate directions will be given,” the DPP’s office said in a tweet. Gitenge appeared at the Milimani Law Courts on July 16. He was charged with causing death through careless driving, driving under the influence of alcohol and failing to report that he had committed a crime. The suspect pleaded not guilty to the first two charges and was fined Sh10,000 for the third charge. He was released on a Sh50,000 cash bail. The family fears there is a conspiracy by police officers to let off their colleague on lighter charges. They feel the offence of driving with the body on his car and trying to conceal the crime should have been included in the charge sheet. "We want him charged for that because it carries more weight," Wambui's brother Simon Ndirangu said. Click here for the latest political stories
