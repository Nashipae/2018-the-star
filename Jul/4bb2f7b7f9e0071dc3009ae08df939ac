Seven police officers were yesterday morning injured in an ambush by suspected al Shabaab militants in Ijara subcounty, Garissa county. The attackers took away an AK47 rifle and a pistol belonging to an inspector. County police commander David Kerina said the officers were escorting a grader when they were ambushed between Sangailu and Handaro. The attackers were heavily armed, Kerina said “Our officers have been injured although they are all out of danger. They have been airlifted to Nairobi for specialised treatment,” he said on the phone. The militants fled after they were  overpowered by the officers. More security officers have been sent to the area to pursue the assailants. The injured officers were treated at Ijara dispensary before being flown to Nairobi. Ijara is near the dense Boni Forest, which is used as a hideout by al Shabaab. Kerina said police are yet to establish casualties among the militants. The militant have targeted security officers on patrol along the Kenya-Somalia border by planting improvise explosive devices on roads. Kerina urged residents of Ijara and Sangailu to report suspicious people to the authorities. The Kenya Defence Forces  has military bases in Kotile, Bothai and Hulugho, which border Boni Forest. Late last  year, militants attacked Ijara police camp and razed it before leaving with ammunition, shop merchandise and a police vehicle. Five GSU officers on patrol were killed on June 6 in the Liboi border town when their vehicle ran over a suspected explosive. Another attack in Wajir county’s Bojigaras claimed the lives of five Administration Police officers and three police reservists. Their vehicle was ambushed by suspected al Shabaab militants.
