The late former Postmaster General Francis Chahonyo was eulogised on Wednesday as a man of the people who should be emulated by many. Thousands of people gathered at Citam church in Nairobi for a requiem mass where speakers described Chahonyo as a mentor, leader, manager, sports lover and philanthropist. The service was filled with relatives, friends, government officials, former colleagues, church members and a number of politicians. “I am glad that no one talked about the material things he left. They all talked about how he changed people’s lives,” Reverend Julian Kyula said. Chahonyo, 72, died at Karen Hospital on June 25 after a long illness. His tenure at Posta was not smooth as he was adversely mentioned in the multibillion shilling Anglo-Leasing scandal. This was in connection with the procurement deal with internet provider VSAT. In 2011, Chahonyo was accused of depositing Sh55 million of the Kenya Sugar Board’s money into collapsed Euro Bank in 2003 while serving as the Managing Director of the Kenya Sugar Authority. He was later acquitted by the Anti-Corruption Court for lack of sufficient grounds for charges. Chahonyo served as the chairman of AFC Leopards in 1998. He helped hundreds of people to get jobs, acquire education and put food on their table while at the pinnacle of his illustrious career. Mourners said Chahonyo’s excellent work ethic, 'huge personality', humility and generous spirit was evident in everything he did. “To the family he was a mentor, a leader and a role model,” his only son Sidney said. “There is a legacy in his generosity, goodness, kindness and integrity. No matter what people say or think with all these court cases and allegations around us, that was the daddy I knew." Chahonyo had seven children with his wife Tabitha Dalizu. His body will be transported from Nairobi on Friday for burial on Saturday at his home in Hombala village in Chavakali, Vihiga County. Click here for the latest political news
