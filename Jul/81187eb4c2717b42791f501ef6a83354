Details have emerged of how Moses Mungai impersonated spy master chief Philip Kameru in dealings with Ruaraka land owner Francis Mburu. Mburu and Mungai recorded statements with Flying Squad officers on Wednesday following their arrests at the former's Kileleshwa home in Nairobi. Officers found a pistol and an ID stating Mungai works for the National Intelligence Service. Police said Mburu told investigators that Mungai demanded Sh10 million to help him sort out the Ruaraka land case. The land owner was released and asked to report to the DCI on Thursday morning while the impersonator remained in police custody. Mburu is the MD of companies that own the Sh3 billion 13.7-acre property occupied by Ruaraka High and Drive Inn Primary schools. He and his sons were arrested by EACC officers on July 20 amid the controversial Ruaraka land probe.
