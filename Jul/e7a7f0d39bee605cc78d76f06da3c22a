Lurambi MP Titus Khamala has said he will talk to secondary school students in his constituency on the importance of dialogue in resolving their grievances.
He said he will take it upon himself to make students understand violence is a costly way of dealing with problems as it results in destruction of property and sometimes death. Khamala spoke to students of Kakamega High School on Monday.
“I have decided to talk to students in my constituency because any further destruction of our schools with fires will attract dire legal consequences. I urge other leaders to engage students,” he said.
More than 30 schools have been closed across the country over fires that have destroyed property, mostly dormitories. More than 100 students have been arrested in connection to the fires.
Education CS Amina Mohamed last week said parents will meet the cost of repairs of schools burnt.
Khamala asked teachers to treat students humanely while dealing with issues that affect them. “We know some principals are hard on students but they need to allow them to be heard,” he said.
Khamala appealed to parents to take their role in mentoring their children seriously, instead of leaving the responsibility to the teachers alone. He said a bill will be tabled in the National Assembly to compel students, who engage in destruction of school property and threaten safety of others, to face criminal charges.
