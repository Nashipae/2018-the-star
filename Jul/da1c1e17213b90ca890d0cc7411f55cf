National Assembly Majority leader Aden
Duale has said Uasin Gishu woman representative Gladys Sholei has not tabled the bill
before the House seeking to scrap the position of women through party nominations. Yesterday, Duale said MPs had resorted to "playing populist games and politics just to
please electorate". “The
problem with the lawmakers is when they write a letter to the speaker they announce that they have tabled a bill,”  he said. "Those letters written to the speaker are neither bills nor
legislative proposals but their opinions. Members have opted to discuss matters before the House in public forums such as
funerals, rallies and women meetings." Duale said the procedure of bringing a legislative proposal
approved by the speaker, subjected to the budget and appropriation committee is clear in the Constitution. He said the only bill before the House is the one he proposed on actualising the constitutional two-thirds gender rule. On Monday some woman reps accused their colleague Gladys Shollei of tabling a bill to scrap the position and increase the number of women in Parliament through election instead of party nominations. Speaking at Madogo during a funds drive, the legislators said the bill as
misplaced and seeks to undermine the position of women in society. They were Rehema Hassan (Tana River), Beatrice Nkatha (Tharaka Nithi), Catherine Wambilianga (Bungoma), Rosa Buyu (Kisumu), Irene Kasalu (Kitui) and Halima Mucheke (nominated). The bill proposes the pairing of constituencies
to form one that will be reserved solely for women. Both genders will vie for seats in the existing constituencies. The bill, if passed, will be a big
blow to party leaders who usually dish out nomination certificates to friends and relatives.
