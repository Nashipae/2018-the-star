ODM has dismissed the poll held by Migori delegates which saw former Minister Ochilo Ayacko take the lead
in party’s Senate nomination. National Elections Board chair Judy Pareno said the party had nothing to do with purported electoral vote which showed Ayacko won by 44 out of 77 votes. "Branch chairmen have no powers to conduct nominations on
behalf of the party," she said in an interview on KTN on Wednesday. This followed Migori branch
chairman Philip Makabong'o's endorsement of Ayacko as the flag bearer in the by-election
slated for October 8. Read: Ayacko gets 44 out 70 electoral college votes in Migori senator race The Migori seat fell vacant after the June 19 death
of Senator Ben Oluoch due to  throat cancer. Pareno said they will instigate disciplinary measures against the branch chairman
for abuse of office. "Makabong’o is a perennial intruder on electoral matters
in Migori county. This time he must be punished," she said. Separately, ODM chairman John Mbadi, citing strict
timelines, said the party will hand-pick a candidate for the Migori race in line with the July 26 deadline. "IEBC has given us a strict timeline for the
submission of our candidate. We will have to
interview the candidates to get the preferred choice for the party." The race has attracted former Rongo constituency law
maker Dalmas Otieno, David Osiany, Mark Okundi - a nephew of the late Senator,
and Okello's eldest son Willis Oluoch. Other contenders are former Migori MP
John Pesa, former Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga, former Eala MP Ochieng Mbeo and
businessman Eddy Oketch. Generally, ODM party primaries in
Nyanza over the past decade have been characterised by incidents of violence. Also read: Ayacko withdraws petition against Obado, to bid for Migori senator Click here for the latest political news
