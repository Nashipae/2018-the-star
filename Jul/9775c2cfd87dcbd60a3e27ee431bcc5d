Ugandan Vinka, alias Veronica Nakiyingi, is in Kenya promoting her song,Â Chips na Ketchup. Speaking to Word Is, Vinka said she was friends with the late Radio Weasel, whom she said was great. "I met Radio because he had written me two songs. Unfortunately he passed on and I did not have a chance to record them, so that really affected me as a person. He was a very smart guy. He would look at some things and create a bigger thing from that, and I miss him." As Ugandan, she still thinks that the Zari and Diamond drama can be sorted out. "Every family has its issues, and the fact that they are in the limelight, their lives cannot be hidden, so that is why it is all over," she said.
