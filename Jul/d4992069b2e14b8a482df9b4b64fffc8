Limuru MP Peter Mwathi has asked the government to investigate the effects of heavy metals on the body, saying many Kenyans may have consumed contaminated sugar. The government said it has seized thousands of tonnes of sugar and some have been contaminated with lead and copper. It’s not clear whether some sugar also contains mercury. Mwathi on Saturday said Kenyans are at risk of developing ailments from consuming the sugar. He said Kenyans are confused over contaminants and how dangerous they are.
