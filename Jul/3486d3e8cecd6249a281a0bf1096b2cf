Investigations into the Ruaraka land
saga read like the script of a dramatic Hollywood blockbuster. A
lot has been divulged and we need a dénouement, a conclusion. Top government officials have been
dragged in and silent tycoons yanked into public in what appears like an endless comedy of errors by a government buying its own land. As it stands, only the Official
Receiver can pull the plug on this circus. It is a fact that the land in question was
charged to Continental Credit Finance Limited for two loans of Sh186 million. Afrison,
the borrower, defaulted on the loan. To date, the original ownership documents
are with the Official Receiver. Banks, even those under receivership or
liquidation, are usually quick to recover bad loans. Why did the Official
Receiver not auction the land to recover the defaulted loan? Assuming the government had occupied
the land by force, why didn't the Official Receiver claim compensation for
compulsory acquisition? The payout would have eased the depositors’ pain. Why was it the borrower, and not the
Official Receiver, claiming compensation from government? Was there a legal
arrangement? Was it in writing? If the loan was repaid, whether partially or in
full, why is the Official Receiver still in custody of the ownership documents? The answers to these questions will
unravel the truth and bring the Ruaraka land circus to a halt!
