Six senior Nairobi county officials and a director of a company were yesterday charged with conspiracy to defraud their employer of Sh150 million. Peter Gitau, Edna Nyaitondi, Ephantus Gitonga, Allan Muchira, Bernard Kigori, and Charles Gatheru denied the charges. Gatheru is the director of Broadways Hardware and General Suppliers, however. The six faced five counts of conspiracy to commit an economic crime, committing a fraudulent act, wilful failure to comply with procurement laws, and deceiving by principal. The prosecution said the county officials conspired with Broadways Hardware, the bidder who was awarded a tender, to defraud the county. The court was informed that they conspired to substitute the tender form which had a price of Sh50 million with another containing a higher price of Sh150 million.

Gitonga, Kigori, Machira and Nyaitondi, who had been appointed to an ad hoc evaluation committee to evaluate the tender, jointly and willfully failed to comply with the law relating to procurement, the prosecution said. The offence was committed on different dates in November 2016. Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi of the anti-corruption ordered each of them to pay a cash bail of Sh 400,000 to secure freedom pending trial. Alternatively, they could pay a deposit of Sh1 million bond and a surety of similar amount to secure their freedom pending trial. Nicholas Maina, another suspect, will take plea later. Anti-corruption officials were given up to August 3 to hand over to the accused evidence that will be relied upon during trial.
