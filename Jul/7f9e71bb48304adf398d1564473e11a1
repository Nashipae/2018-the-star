Interior CS Fred Matiang’i yesterday said he is being harassed because of his fight against white collar crimes. Matiang’i, however, said he will soldier on and do his job. "I will not be stopped by the intimidation. I was summoned to appear before parliamentary committees 11 times in a week. That is part of the intimidation, but the fight must go." Without being specific, the CS said some people have paid mainstream and social media users to taint his name. He spoke at Nyabisase Secondary School in Bobasi, Kisii, during a funds drive. The CS said he will not be cowed by the cartels. "We know who meets who at night because I’m the Interior CS. I will not lie to please people. If it’s poison I will say it." Matiang'i, speaking at
Nyabisase Secondary School in Bobasi, Kisii county during a funds
drive, the CS said the cartels will not cow him. "I’m a son a
peasant but I have risen to be a CS. It’s the will of God for me to be where I am.
God sits on his throne. Nobody will get a leadership position that God has not
planned for you. I will continue speaking the truth and those people should
stop their nonsense," he said. On the
increasing cases of bhang and cattle rustling, the CS said a meeting has been
convened bringing together security chiefs from Narok, Nyamira, Kisii, and
Migori counties to brainstorm on how to end the vices. He was
accompanied by Transport CAS Chris Obure, Bobasi MP Innocent Obiri, Bomachoge MP Alfa Miruka and
his Kitutu Chache North MP Jimmy Angwenyi. Miruka asked
Matiang'i to investigate claims that Kenyan Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) workers
are mistreated by Chinese. "We accept
donor funding but let this not be used to mistreat our people. The era of slave
trade is long gone. If Chinese are holding jobs that Kenyans can do, let those
jobs be given to Kenyans," the MP said.
