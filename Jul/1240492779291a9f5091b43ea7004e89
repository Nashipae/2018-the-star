Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has denied the county has two official governor’s residences. He said his government had established in Lugari a small residence-cum-office for use by the governor when working in the northern part of Lugari, Likuyani and Malava sub-counties. “There has been this issue that the governor has two residences.This is completely wrong information. We’ve had an issue of land for construction of the governor’s residence in Kakamega,” he said. “We have provided for funds for that purpose in our budgets since 2016 but it has not happened because of land issues,” Oparanya added. Oparanya said the government obtained two plots for construction of the official residence but a certain individual claimed ownership of one of the plots, delaying construction. “We have asked the National Land Commission to address the issue and if it fails, we have identified private land near River Isiukhu, which we shall then negotiate and purchase,” he said. Oparanya spoke yesterday when he assented to the Kakamega County Appropriation Bill 2018 allowing his government to spend the Sh14.5 billion passed by the county assembly last Thursday. The county has set aside Sh93 million for development under the office of governor. The Salaries and Remuneration Commission has given county governments until the end of this year to construct official residences for governors or lose the benefits they enjoy for lacking the facility. But the Senate Public Accounts Committee has faulted the directive saying it has opened a window for counties to make huge allocations for the residences. PAC wants the residences standardised.
