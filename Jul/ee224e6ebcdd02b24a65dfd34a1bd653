Jeff Bezos is the richest man in modern human history. The founder and CEO of online retail giant Amazon is now worth $150billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The $150billion mark breaks the record once held by Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who at the height of the dot-com boom was worth $149billion after adjusting for inflation. In 1999, Gates’ net worth hit its peak, reaching $100billion, which in today’s dollars translates into $149billion. For years, Gates and Bezos were neck-and-neck in the race to be the world’s richest human. But the former Microsoft chief has donated a large chunk of his fortune to charity and has devoted himself to philanthropic endeavors. Gates is currently worth $95.5billion, according to Bloomberg. Shares of Amazon were up by the end of trading on Wall Street on Monday. The company closed at $1,822.49 per share, up over nine points from Friday. Amazon’s stock price and profits are likely to receive another upward jolt on Monday thanks to its annual Prime Day bonanza. But it has not been an entirely smooth roll-out for the company. Amazon says it's working to resolve the glitches on its website that kept shoppers from buying on its much-hyped Prime Day. The hiccups could mute sales and send shoppers elsewhere on one of Amazon's busiest sales days. Shoppers clicking on many Prime Day links after the 3pm ET Monday launch in the US got only images of dogs - some quite abashed-looking - with the words, ‘Uh-oh. Something went wrong on our end.’ Many took to social media to complain. By about 4:30pm, many Prime Day links were working. In a statement, Amazon says that many people are shopping successfully, and that in the first hour of Prime Day in the US, customers ordered more items compared to the first hour last year.
