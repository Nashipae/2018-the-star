   Garissa senator Yusuf Haji got a major win on Friday after the Court of
the Appeal struck out a petition to challenge his victory in last year's election. Haji's win had been upheld by the High Court in February. But Mohamed Abdi had appealed the decision by justice Rose Ougo, saying the senator was not validly elected. Abdi wanted the appeal court to overturn Ougo's decision. Haji however said the
notice of appeal was lodged outside the stipulated time required and asked
the court to strike it out. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) also asked the court to dismiss the application, saying it was filed at the High Court registry and
did not comply with the required format. Abdi defended the appeal, saying the failure to file it within time was an "inadvertent mistake." The petitioner said there
was no prejudice and the lapse of time in filing the appeal was curable with
procedural technicality. In their ruling, appellate judges Phillip Waki, Asike
Makhandia and Agnes Murgor said the documents filed by Abdi against Haji were a nullity since they were filed at the High Court and not in the Court of
Appeal registry. The bench also said the notice was filed out of time. “It follows that no notice of appeal was filed in this
matter and the court has no jurisdiction to consider the extension of time
sought,” the judges said. “The notices of
motion by Mohamed Aden Abdi dated and filed on April 9 and 17 are hereby
dismissed.”
