Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has bowed to pressure from MCAs and residents and scrapped the Sh30, 000 fee for issuance of title deeds to squatters. This came on Tuesday as the Governor commissioned the construction of roads in Eastlands area. Land executive Charles Kerich earlier said the money would be for five law firms that the county asked to process leases and title deeds for residents. Details: Residents will pay Sh30,000 for titles Sonko has, however, ordered no charges for squatters who are to get 50,000 deeds. “The county government will pay for them ... they should not be worried,” he said, adding his administrations will work with MCAs to identify genuine squatters. He noted that the gesture has not been extended to landlords who can raise the fee. More on this: Uhuru, Sonko to issue 50,000 title deeds to Eastlands residents Majority leader Abdi Guyo, whose Matopeni-Spring Valley ward also benefited, reiterated Sonko's announcement. "If you have flats or permanent houses, that means you are capable and in that regard, you will have to pay the fees,” he said. The county government has been at loggerheads with beneficiaries and MCAs over the matter. Some MCAs had asked their constituents not to pay the fee, claiming the lawyers were conmen taking advantage of their desperation. Last week, Majority Chief Whip Mwaura Chege asked the county lands department to shed light on the issuance of the titles. Sonko spoke in Kayole while launching the construction of the Matopeni estate access road. Transport executive Mohamed Dagane said the 1.5 km pathway is one of 15 roads that are being re-carpeted by the county and national governments. It is will cost Sh110 million and will be completed in six months. Kayole Spine and Mihango roads are among those that will be repaird. Dagane said most of the projects will have begun in two weeks as they will soon award contracts.
