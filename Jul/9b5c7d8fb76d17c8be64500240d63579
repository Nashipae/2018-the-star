Manufacturers want the government to triple its export value within three years for the manufacturing sector to realise its target under the Big Four agenda. Kenya Association of Manufacturers chairperson Flora Mutahi said there is need to cut the Sh1.73 trillion import bill and push up the export value from Sh530.62 billion to Sh1.8 trillion to expand the industrial sector and stabilise the economy. She said plans to enhance manufacturing will not be realised unless the country reverses the imbalance between its export and imports. Latest data from Central Bank shows import orders hit Sh22.33 billion in the January-April period. This was a 133.08 per cent rise compared to a bill of Sh9.58 billion over a similar period in 2017. Topping the import list are animal and vegetable oils, minerals, fuels, lubricants, machinery and transport equipment, beverages and tobacco. “What we are currently witnessing is an unfortunate increase in imported goods being procured by public entities,” said KAM chief executive Phylis Wakiaga. She said for the country to realise its development goals, it must shift from being a net importer to a producer.
