Lawyers representing former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga in a case of robbery with violence have protested against delays in the trial. Njenga is charged alongside five people, including businessman Francis Mwangi, Wanjohi Ngare and Stephen Kuria, with violently robbing three police officers of guns and cash. The crime allegedly took place at his Hope Church at Thome state in Nairobi’s Kasarani area seven years ago. The matter was to be heard on Friday before Milimani Trial Magistrate Martha Mutuku but did not proceed due to the repeated absence of prosecution witnesses. This prompted defence lawyers Danstan Omar, Kiraithe Wandungi and Evans Ondieki to raise a complaint. The lawyers accused the prosecution of deliberately delaying the case, by failing to avail witnesses, so that it does not proceed to a full trial.  They told the court that the team had made several applications for adjournments in the case. Omar and the others further noted that their clients have never skipped court. The magistrate pushed the case until August, with a warning to the prosecution that this was the last adjournment and that the case would proceed to a full hearing without any other delays. The parties had agreed to a full trial since main complainant Joseph Thuo did not withdraw charges against Njenga and the others. Thuo had said he would withdraw the case, saying in a sworn affidavit that he wanted to promote peace and reconciliation. He said he had not been forced to do so. Njenga and the others are accused of unlawfully holding the police officers for hours in one of the rooms at the church and damaging a government vehicle. They denied the charges and are out on a surety bond of Sh200,000.
