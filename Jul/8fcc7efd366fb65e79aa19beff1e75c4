When Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji took office on March 28, he warned it wasn't going to be business as usual, especially in fighting corruption. In about 100 days, the former NIS deputy director has taken landmark decisions involving theft by public servants. Among other things, the DPP has arraigned more than 50 people linked to the NYS scam, charged Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong with abuse of office and ordered the arrest of the entire management of Kenya Power. He also ordered the arrest of directors of 33 firms irregularly awarded power tenders. The DPP will soon decide on a number of high-profile files presented by the DCI and EACC. Numerous corruption scandals over the years have exposed the failures of anti-graft agencies and political leadership. They also exposed the weak links between investigative, prosecutorial and enforcement agencies. But with President Uhuru Kenyatta vowing to end corruption, Haji, DCI boss George Kinoti and the EACC have forged a team working with synergy, urgency and purpose. This time we hope there will be watertight cases and serious evidence adduced in court so the judiciary can punish the guilty in accordance with the law.
