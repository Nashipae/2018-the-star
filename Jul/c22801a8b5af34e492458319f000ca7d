The newly appointed National Youth Service acting director general Matilda Sakwa says she has what it takes to kick out the cartels. She told the Star on Tuesday that she is determined to bring back the institution’s lost glory. Sakwa said the cartels that have made NYS their "bedrooms" should back off and let the institution work for the Kenyan youth. “Just keep off! Let’s do good business with honest contractors with a view to achieving the goals of NYS. It’s a challenging position, all eyes are on me but I trust that I'm equal to the task. My experience and hard work has been rewarded and I will not betray this trust," she said. She added; "I will be the acting DG until further notice just to clear up the mess." Sakwa who has been serving as Machakos County Commissioner said scandals in the NYS are eroding the gains Kenya has made to assist young people to get gainful employment. “I will be going to NYS with a clear mind, work with the team to bring back the lost glory of NYS. The institution’s focus should be on young men and women we are nurturing,” Sakwa told the Star. She will assume office on Wednesday. “It’s morally wrong when you betray the trust given to lead such an organization that brings hope to the youth. I thank the government for entrusting me with such assignment,” she said. Sakwa replaces former NYS Director General Richard Ndubai who is facing corruption charges.
