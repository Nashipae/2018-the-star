Nairobi County Attorney has dismissed claims of City Hall's legal department paying outrageous fees to specifc law firms representing the county in various court cases. This comes after Minority Whip Peter Imwatok accused the legal department of hiring several lawyers to represent them in small cases, ending up paying them millions of shillings. County Attorney Lydia Kwamboka rubbished claims that two advocates were paid in excess of Sh35 million. Last Thursday, Imwatok put Justice and legal Affairs Committee chairman Jayendra Malde on the spot, asking him to table a statement indicating all the legal payments the county has made to lawyers representing them in different cases. Imwatok also questioned why the county continues to hire private lawyers despite having a legal department. Jayendra, who is also Parklands MCA, was further asked to explain the hiring of many advocates, the amounts paid or due for payment to the lawyers who represented the county in the AAR case. The minority whip said the millions of shillings paid to the two lawyers would have been spent on improving public services. “The county’s legal fees malaise is well known, and the rot in the sector well established. A dangerous trend is creeping back where private lawyers connive to have litigation matters, even the lightest, issued to upwards of seven law firms or lawyers,” Imwatok said. Last month, a court dismissed a case filed by Imwatok. He had sued Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko in connection with the alleged loss of Sh1.7 billion through irregular procurement of health services for staff. In the recently approved 2018-19 budget, the legal department has been allocated Sh196.8 million.
