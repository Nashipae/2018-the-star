The Senate has set up its own committee to investigate the sugar scandal because it was not happy with the report by the Trade and Agriculture Committee of the National Assembly Similarly, both Houses have committees that are investigating the Solai dam tragedy, and in the past both had committees looking into KQ and NYS. Not only is this a waste of money but it also creates the risk of conflicting reports by different parliamentary committees. The speakers of the two Houses need to resolve this problem promptly. They should decide between themselves whether a committee of the Senate or the National Assembly should investigate a particular issue. However, there will be some cases of overwhelming national interest, which would normally be handled by the National Assembly, and also of overwhelming local interest, which would normally be handled by the Senate. In these special cases, the speakers can set up a joint committee of both the Senate and the National Assembly to probe and report.
