People living near London Distillers Ltd in Athi River have raised concerns over continued pollution by the firm. They want the National Assembly Environmental and Natural Resources Committee, which carried out a probe, to release its report. Residents claim the committee is withholding the report. “The aim of this compromise is to manipulate and doctor the report from the investigations the committee conducted so that LDK comes out clean,” a source told the Star on Sunday. But Kareke Mbiuki, who chairs the team, said “everyone is entitled to their feelings.” He said the report is set to be tabled before the National Assembly this week. In March, the team summoned the firm’s managing director to respond to complaints of pollution.
