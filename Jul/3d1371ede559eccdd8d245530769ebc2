Disabled persons in Mwingi and Migwani in Kitui county have received business equipment worth Sh1.2 million. They got salon kits, knitting machines, barberâ€™s tools, sewing machines, ploughs and wheelchairs. Association of Physically Disabled of Kenya acting CEO Joyce Mutua gave out the equipment and said the 59 beneficiaries should use the tools for personal advancement. Mutua urged the beneficiaries to start income generating ventures to become self-reliant and employ other people. They should change their attitude from relying on handouts to earning their own living, she said. Mwingi central subcounty deputy commissioner Omar Dima urged parents with disabled children to come out and receive support to educate them.
