A woman accused of assault yesterday produced in an Embu court underwear she claimed to be her accuser’s. Ann Rwamba is charged with assaulting Prisca Gatiri. Rwamba said Gatiri abandoned the item in her bed after she caught her sleeping with her husband.  Resident magistrate Samuel Mutai overruled her and said the underwear was not directly linked to the alleged assault on Gatiri. Rwamba has denied the charge and said she was assaulted by the complainant. Gatiri said Rwamba waylaid her and wrestled her to the ground. She said Rwamba also accused her of being a whore and having an affair with her husband, and threatened to stab her. The hearing will be on August 22.
