Kenya Sevens skipper Oscar Ayodi is confident that the side can improve on their previous two semifinal positions in the last two World Cups at this weekend’s global show in San Francisco, USA Kenya bowed out at the semifinal stage in both the 2009 and 2013 World Cups, losing to Argentina in Dubai and England in Moscow respectively. Ayodi said they have learnt from the previous World Cups and will be seeking to go all way this time round and do the country proud. The team has four survivors from the last World Cup Sevens, including talisman Collins Injera who will be playing his third World Cup, Andrew Amonde, Eden Agero and Willy Ambaka. This year’s tournament format has been changed with knockout matches from the preliminary round all the way to the final. In previous years, the 24 teams were pooled into groups of four with the top two sides advancing to the quarters. Ayodi insists they have nothing to fear. “We must bring our ‘A’ game from the first match to the last. The margin of error is small and one wrong pass or a missed tackle can cost you,” added Ayodi. He added that the standoff between the union and players in the last few days will not affect the side. “We have put this issues aside and we have focused on the task at hand in trying to win the World Cup,” he added. Kenya open their campaign against Tonga on Friday. They then face Scotland in the second round if they win before tackling series champions South Africa in quarters in case they progress. The team departed the country last night.
