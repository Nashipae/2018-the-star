The musical chairs in the media industry have began. Jackie Nyaminde, whose alter ego is Wibroda, is rumoured to have moved from Citizen Radio and headed to Milele FM. The news of Wilbroda leaving comes at a time where her co-host Francis Luchivya had already announced that he will be leaving the radio station. This was coupled by the Royal Media Services head of radio's announcement that she is also headed to Milele FM. The mass exodus caused such a furore at the Dennis Pritt-based media house that there was a crisis meeting to contain the haemorrhage, which also includes other top-ranking managers at Citizen radio. What is not clear, though, is if Inspekta Wamala will also be leaving. Speaking to Word Is, Wilbroda said, "I will be starting my new job In the course of this month, but I don't want to reveal the date yet because we will have to make bit of noise about it." She added that she will be maintaining her stage name, Wilbroda, in her new job. "I will still play the role I have been playing, but I will also welcome any other role that will come from there." However she says her character role is changing but she will still be doing comedy. "Be sure it is comedy but am I am changing the role you have all known me for, but I will still be a comedian. The same person who has made her fans laugh, is the same one you will get at Milele FM," she said, adding, "Changing my name is still under discussion for now." Meanwhile, award-winning KTN news anchor Mashirima Kapombe is headed to Citizen TV. She is known for her impeccable delivery of news in Kiswahili, which has earned her many fans. She is headed to Citizen, where she will boost the Kiswahili desk with her brand of reporting. Also, she will be a valuable addition after Lulu Hassan starts her maternity leave soon. And former Ebru TV news anchor Doreen Gatwiri is said to be joining NTV to boost the Kiswahili desk after RMZ raided it.
