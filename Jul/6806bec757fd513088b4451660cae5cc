Twelve pupils from Kichare Primary school, Homa Bay county have been admitted at Nyando sub county hospital after the bus they were travelling in was involved in a road accident. The accident occurred at Korowe area near Kisumu. Thirty five students sustained slight injuries. Nyanza Region Traffic Commander Andrew Naibei told the Star on phone that the driver of the bus could have lost control forcing it to fall on one side as a result of poor weather. "It was drizzling when the incident occurred and it seems like the driver could not see the road well." Naibei said. The students were on their way back to Homa Bay after attending a music festival event in Kisumu. The bus belonging to Tonga Boys Secondary School was carrying forty seven students and one teacher.
