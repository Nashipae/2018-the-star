The Kenya Parents Association has proposed to the Ministry of Education that all pupils in Kenya should wear the same school uniform. Apparently headmasters are forcing parents to buy uniforms from specified shops at inflated prices. If uniforms are standardised, then prices can be controlled. The ministry is seriously considering the proposal, plus the idea that NYS and Rivatex could manufacture the uniforms, thereby reviving the garment industry. But do we want all schools to look the same? Every school develops its own ethos including its school uniform which is something to be proud of. It builds team spirit. The school uniform also marks out pupils so you can see which school they attend. If they misbehave, they can easily be identified. So it is not a good idea to put all Kenyan pupils in the same school uniform. If the problem is collusion between headmasters and school outfitters, the simple solution is for the Education ministry to issue recommended price guidelines for items of school uniform.
