More than 70 groups in Kakamega have received Sh33 million from the National Affirmative Action Fund. Public Service, Youth and Gender CAS Rachael Shebesh presented the cheques on Wednesday. She urged Luhya women to form or join Saccos to access credit from the Women Enterprise Fund and improve their lives. Shebesh told residents not to fear loans. She said one cannot succeed in business without loans. The CAS spoke in Solyo, Shinyalu. “Compete for loans with other regions like Central who have known the importance. Don’t fear at all, especially these ones from the Women Enterprise Fund. They have a long period of repayment and have no interest charges,” she said. Shebesh also urged residents to support President Uhuru Kenya and Raila Odinga’s pact.
