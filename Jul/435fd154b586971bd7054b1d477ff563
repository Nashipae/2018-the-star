The Capital Markets Authority has formed a multi-agency strategy to end a listing drought at the Nairobi Securities Exchange. It incorporates the National Treasury, CMA, NSE, Central Depository and Settlement Corporation, Fund Managers Association, the Kenya Association of Stockbrokers and Investment Banks, licensed market intermediaries and the East African Venture Capital Association. A joint statement with NSE said the low listings and overall product uptake could adversely affect key national development goals and realisation of Vision 2030.
