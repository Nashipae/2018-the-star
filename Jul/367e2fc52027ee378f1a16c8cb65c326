The Public Relations Society of Kenya plans to tighten regulations among the public relations practitioners to improve professional . The society yesterday launched a five year strategic plan that seeks to get legislation that among others seeks to formulate legislation and define the role of public relations professionals. The society plans to bring before parliament a bill that will set the standard for practice and required education qualifications. This she said will anchor the practice of public relations in law. The bill will make enable the society to offer training and practice certificates to members. Currently, the society only offers an annual membership certificate. PRSK chairperson Jane Gitau said despite Kenya's advanced public relations and information management industry the profession faces challenges from low or lack of entry barriers. “The current policies allows members to join and leave the society as they want, this has caused operational incapacity and wanting professional ethics. The industry is also troubled with people masquerading as public relations experts,” Gitau said. Gitau said that the plan will guide PR practitioners to make informed decisions and solutions that respond practically to clients needs. She said the PRSK will take the model of Law Society of Kenya under which all practicing lawyers must be members. “A registered member with LSK cannot leave to practice legal matters outside the society. We aim to borrow this and bring behavioral change to defective firms and individuals,” she said. Broadcasting and telecommunications PS Rahab Nyaga said local universities need to provide stand alone degrees on public relations. “While there is a great need to improve on professional public relation practices, there is no a single university offering the course at a degree level. It is often taken as a unit or integrated with Journalism or Communication course,” Nyaga said.
