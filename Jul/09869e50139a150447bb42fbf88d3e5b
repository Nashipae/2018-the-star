Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu has cautioned students to abstain from sex and leave it to "married people". Mwilu was speaking at Thitani girls on Saturday during the price giving day to Catholic-sponsored schools in Kitui County where she was the chief guest. She said its shameful for school going children to involve themselves in sex, get pregnant and drop out of school. "I don't know how that works because after I got my first child I lost all my concentration. I don't know if those who have given birth and resumed with studies concentrate in class at all," she added. The deputy CJ asked teachers to behave responsibly when handling students. "Some pretend to be coaching the girls in the staff room and end up molesting them. I always wonder where is your wife as you do that to school girls. Even if you are not married why can't you get a woman of your age and size and get married to them," she wondered. Mwilu reminded men that if caught, the sexual offence act attracts at least 15-years imprisonment. She told teachers not to discourage students. "No child is foolish and unteachable as the teachers would say. While i was in form three, my mathematics teacher made me drop from 80 to 15 per cent but iÂ had to recollect myself", she said.
