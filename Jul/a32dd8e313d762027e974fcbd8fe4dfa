A student was injured on Thursday and 15 parents arrested during chaos at a primary school in Eldoret where Uasin Gishu county workers were evicted from staff houses. The parents who were attending a prayer meeting for KCPE exam candidates teamed up with the pupils to evict the “strangers.” They said teachers could not suffer for lack of houses yet employees of the county government were living in houses meant for the tutors. Eldoret police boss Julius Lingole said police arrived after the parents had already broken doors to all the houses. Uasin Gishu Primary School Board chairman Joseph Mwalo asked the ministry to investigate. Uasin Gishu deputy governor Daniel Chemno said they will probe the violence.
