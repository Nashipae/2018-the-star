Grandpa Records' Refigah has gotten us used to expecting the best from him. He puts his everything in what he does and over the years, we've seen his great work, which has won him awards. Not everything is about work, though. Family members should also be celebrated, and that's exactly what Refigah did. Refigah threw his beautiful wife a grand surprise birthday party at the Fairview Hotel in Nairobi. Like the queen she is, Yasmin was driven to the venue in a exquisite limousine, and upon arrival, she walked on the red carpet to the hotel. She was showered with love by her husband, family and friends. Refigah really outdid himself on this one, and we think it was beautiful.
