The government has reiterated its commitment to improving the welfare of those living with disability. Labour and Social Protection Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani yesterday said they will update data on the disabled and disaggregated them by age, gender and location. Yatani spoke in London during the opening of the first ever Global Disability Summit. The conference is hosted jointly by the UK and Kenya. It is aimed at galvanising efforts to address disability following another summit held in Nairobi in May. Good practice and innovation from Kenya and elsewhere will be showcased for improved inclusion of the disabled in international development. Africa Regional Inclusion Advisor at HelpAge International Talal Waheed said the disabled face systematic neglect in developing countries, including Kenya. â€œWhen age and gender intersect with disability, the vulnerability of the disabled is multiplied," Talal said.
