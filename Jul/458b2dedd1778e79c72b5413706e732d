Gitobu said he was delighted that his effort had been noticed. "What we struggled for was not for personal reward it was for good of this country. Kenya is a great country despite graft, extrajudicial killings and violation of human rights in comparative terms we are ahead of many countries but we are not there," Gitobu said. He lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta and said he has shown commitment to fight graft. "It is the first time I have seen a head of state of this country showing commitment to fight graft," he said.
