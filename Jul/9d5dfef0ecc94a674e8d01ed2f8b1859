Harambee Starlets bid to record their first win in the ongoing Cecafa women’s Championships failed once again as the Kenyans succumbed to a 1-0 defeat against Ethiopia at the Stade Régional de Nyamirambo in Kigali, Rwanda. The result means Kenyans are still pegged at the bottom of the table with one point from three matches and out of contention. Ethiopians, on the other hand, have six points from three matches. Ethiopia scored the lone goal in the 30th minute through Tesfamariam Abera. Starlets face Rwanda next on Friday in their last match of the five-nation event. Starlets’ coach David Ouma effected one change in the starting line-up as he rested Mercy Achieng for Martha Amunyolete in the striking department while for the second time, experienced defender Wendy Achieng was overlooked for Vivian Nasake in the defence. Ethiopia were better side for the better part of the match as Kenya rarely attacked. The Ethiopians showed the urge to score and it didn’t come as surprise when Abera scored in the 30th minute through a free kick to put Ethiopia in the lead. Kenyans then begun to grow in the game and created a few chances but on many occasions were rendered off side as they trailed 1-0 into the break. On Resumption, Ouma made a double substitution, resting Martha Amunyolete and Cynthia Shilwatso for Teresia Engesha and Cheris Avilia and the move brought some life into the line-up as they pressed for the equaliser. Defender Dorcas Sikobe could have restored parity from a well taken corner by Mwanahalima Adams in the 50th minute but her shot went wide. Mercy Achieng was on target in the 90th minute but her goal was ruled for offside. In an Interview, Kenya coach Ouma said: “You win some, draw and lose some. We will go back to the drawing board and see what happens.”
