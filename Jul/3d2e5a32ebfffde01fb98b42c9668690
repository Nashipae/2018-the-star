Majority of intra-African market flights depart with less than 150 passengers on board, making use of large aircrafts uneconomical, according to an aircraft manufacturer. Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer on Wednesday demonstrated its latest aircraft to Kenya Airways hoping to convince the airline to adopt the E190-E2 ‘Profit Hunter for its short haul flights. Embraer’s vice president sales and marketing for Africa and Middle East Raul Villaron said a smaller aircraft will help boost the airline’s daily direct frequencies to destinations that would ordinarily require links through major capitals. The Profit Hunter carries a maximum of 150 passengers. KQ has been using the 15 Embraer E190 for the past eight years. It plans to either lease or buy the new model. According to Sabre Airline Solutions 2017, 61 per cent of African routes in under-served markets are served with less than one daily flight. Among the challenges that alienate large aircraft in most destinations within Africa is distance, destination and nature of aircraft used. The study indicated that some market routes are too long for turboprop engines and too thin for a narrow body aircraft. KQ chief operating officer Jan De Vegt said they are still in talks with Embraer and will decide whether to buy or lease the new models though it is still too early to comment.
