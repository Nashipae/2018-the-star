Four members of a family were on Monday burnt to death in Ijara, Likoni, after a fire broke out following a domestic row.
Three others are fighting for their lives at Coast General Hospital.
Police said a Tanzanian man allegedly started the fire. His 26-year-old wife, who was a teacher at girls’ secondary school, her mother, the couple’s son, four, and their six-year-old nephew perished.
Likoni deputy county commissioner Eric Wamulevu said the owner of the house, Adam Kurusi, reported that the couple had quarrelled.
The husband is reported to have stormed out of the house and returned with petrol. He is said to have poured the petrol in the house and set it on fire.
Wamulevu said neighbours, the police and the fire brigade put out the fire. The husband was rescued and rushed to hospital.
Wamulevu said the survivors were first taken to Likoni District Hospital before being transferred to Coast General Hospital.
Neighbours yesterday said the couple fought a lot.

They said the mother-in-law was against her daughter marrying a boda boda operator, as she was educated and had a well-paying job.
A neighbour called Yussuf said the man had vowed never to be separated from his wife.
“When they fought on Monday night, we thought it was normal. However, we were surprised when the house was set on fire and lives were lost,” he said.
Yusuf said they tried to enter the burning house, but it had been locked from inside with a padlock. He said the fire spread fast because of exploding gas cylinders and wind.
“We heard the family crying for help. We broke a window and pulled out the husband and two other people,” he said.
When the Star went to the scene, neighbours were huddled in groups speaking in hushed tones. A probe is underway.
