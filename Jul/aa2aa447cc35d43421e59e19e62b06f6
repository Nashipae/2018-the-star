Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has denied reports that he has declared his presidential candidature for 2022. "My position is that 2022 agenda is not a matter of discussion or focus right now," Gideon said on Monday. He said he had been misquoted while presiding over a fund drive at AIC church in Emining, Mogotio sub-county on Sunday. Gideon, son of retired president Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi said hisÂ focus is to support President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four agenda. "...which I believe will translate positively to all aspects of the Kenyan society, and addressing insecurity issues, is of the utmost importance," he said The KANU party chairman further alluded that 2022 succession politics is an emotive issue which excites the country and there has been misinformation in the media, both social and mainstream, as regards his candidature. "I did not at any given time during the functions over the weekend state that I will vie for the presidency in 2022" he reiterates. He said coming from the General elections hardly a year ago, he recognizes the fact that the country needs development first.
