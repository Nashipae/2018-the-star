Garissa Governor Ali Korane yesterday told local charity organisations and donors to support orphanages. He hosted officials from Qatar Charity who fund two orphanages. Korane said vulnerable children stand an equal chance at success if they go to school. The governor said there are hundreds of vulnerable children who need help. He said charity and donor agencies should pool resources to help the children. Qatar Charity is running a programme to finance the daily upkeep and education of 390 orphans in Garissa town for up to Sh21 million. The governor said for some time the orphanages have been facing problems since some local donors are not licensed. Korane was with deputy governor Abdi Dagane. He said his administration will invest in orphanages by upgrading the old ones. New ones will also be constructed, Korane said, to meet the rising demand, especially in remote areas. The governor said Sh100 million has been allocated this year to build new centres in Garissa town. In three years, the county plans to have 3,000 orphans in the centres. Korane added that his administration will partner with like-minded groups to rescue more children and have more centres. “It is our plan to ensure these children are accommodated and have access to education and religious guidance.” Qatar Charity director Mohamed Hussein promised to increase funding in the future to cater for the increased demand.
