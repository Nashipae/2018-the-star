Kisii’s head of public service Patrick Lumumba has warned employees against flocking his office seeking favours. Lumumba, who is also the county secretary, said public officers have been hanging around his office soliciting promotions, redesignations and transfers in total disregard of procedures. He directed that all human resource matters be channeled through departmental human resource committees. “The habit of officers flocking the county secretary’s office soliciting for promotions, redesignations and transfers is totally a unlawful,” Lumumba said in a circular dated July 11. “I direct that all the officers channel their issues to the departmental human resource committees. Laid down procedures must be followed to the latter,” he added. The Secretary said those who continue with the habit will be disciplined. “Any officer who will be found soliciting for the same in the office of the county secretary shall face disciplinary action,” he said. In January 2018, Lumumba said that chief officers were directed to constitute departmental human resource management advisory committee to advise the county human advisory committee on matters affecting staff. Last Month, Lumumba issued other circular warning county employees against using parking stickers as an excuse for not paying parking levies. In the circular, the Secretary said the stickers were for use only at the staff parking areas. He said the County Finance Act does not exempt any staff from paying the parking charges. “All Kisii county staff are warned against using parking stickers to park their personal cars in public slots,” he said.
