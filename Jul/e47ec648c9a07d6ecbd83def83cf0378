The gun used to shoot a Kiambu politician at a Limuru club last August had been issued to the DCI officer charged with the murder. Edward Munjalu (pictured) was charged with killing William Mwangi. On Wednesday, the High Court in Kiambu heard that a report showed the pistol issued to Munjalu fired the spent cartridges collected from the crime scene. Hassan Ditto, the officer in charge of firearms at the DCI headquarters, said the firearms movement book indicated that on August 15, Munjalu of the DCI Child Protection Unit, was given a pistol and 15 bullets. He said the firearm was not returned. Ballistic examiner Florence Karimi said exhibits were brought to her by Tigoni police stationâ€™s DCI boss. He said the cartridges from the scene were fired from the same firearm issued to the accused. U-Turn Club manager George Karuga said he knew the accused as an officer attached to Tigoni police station and the deceased as a regular customer and the two hung out together at the club. The hearing continues on December 11.
