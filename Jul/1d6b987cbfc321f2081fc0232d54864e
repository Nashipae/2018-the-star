 The polio vaccine given to children under the age of five is safe, the government has
said. Parents have complained about their children falling sick after the jab. But director of medical services Jackson Kioko yesterday said there is no cause for alarm. He said the sicknesses could be a result of an influenza virus outbreak. “What the
mothers may not be aware of is that this is the season of
the influenza virus outbreak. You may not tell whether what the child
is experiencing is because of the polio vaccine or other
conditions," Kioko told the Star on the phone. He said the ministry was receiving data indicating that the flu has been in season
from mid last month. It can continue through to August. "The flu mainly
affects children below the age of five due to low immunity,” Kioko said. Last week, the
government conducted a four-day campaign on polio
vaccinate in which 2.4 million children aged five and below were targeted. The campaign was carried out in 12
high-risk counties. Kioko said they were
using a monovalent oral polio vaccine to prevent a viral infection. He said the challenges mothers pointed out could be due to the existing influenza virus. “Mothers should
not worry because this is what we have been using in our past polio
vaccine campaigns," He said. Previous vaccinations have had no problems. He asked people to study the timing of the vaccine and the disease trend in
the country. "But I want to assure mothers that they should not worry
about anything,” Kioko said. Kenya was set to
be certified polio-free this year if no outbreaks were reported. But a case on April 6 threatens that achievement after traces of polio type two
virus were found in a sewage in Kamukunji. The virus
has also been reported in countries such as DR Congo, Syria and Papua Guinea. The latter was however declared and
certified polio free in 2000 by the World Health Organisation.
