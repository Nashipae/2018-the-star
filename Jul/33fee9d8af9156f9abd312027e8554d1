Police in Siaya have asked car owners to be wary of thieves duplicating keys to steal vehicles. They are targeting car washes, garages and hired vehicles, Siaya police boss Ancent Kaloki said. Kaloki said reports of stolen cars had increased over the last month. “We haven't traced any, although we've established that workers at car washers are colluding with thugs from Uganda to steal vehicles,” Kaloki said. Kaloki said the workers duplicate keys which are given to the thieves who later follow the vehicle to a parking at either hotels or bars to steal it. "Most stolen cars end up in Uganda where they dismantled and valuable parts sold," Kaloki said.
