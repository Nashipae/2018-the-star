The Anglican church is ready to readmit three priests from Mt Kenya West Diocese who had been suspended over homosexuality allegations. However, they first have to seek forgiveness from worshippers, Anglican Church of Kenya Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit said. The Labour court in Nyeri ordered the reinstatement of bishops John Gachau, Paul Warui, and Maina Maigua. The court directed that they be paid Sh6.8 million in compensation. Sapit said the church will obey the court order. "But it must be known that the church leadership cannot force its followers to be shepherded by a person they donâ€™t want," he said on Tuesday. Sapit spoke in Nyeri, barely days after furious worshippers chased away the priests from their previous stations in Witima, Thunguri and Kariki, all in Othaya. The bishops have sued the church for defamation. Sapit urged worshippers to remain calm and avoid debate on the matter. "The only way to bring this matter to an end is to remain silent because adavancing the debate will put you in the same level with our competitor," he said. Sapit said the church does not allow homosexuality, adultery and fornication and those those found committing them will not be allowed in church. Click here for the latest political news
