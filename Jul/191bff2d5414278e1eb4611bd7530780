Even as the High Court ordered the Music Copyright Society of Kenya to account for the money it has collected as royalties and licence fees since January 1 last year, the association may have deeper infighting problems. The directors of the CMO suspended the CEO, Merit Simiyu, three months ago. Speaking to Word Is, Simiyu said, "I have been advised to go to the Kecobo offices on Thursday to know what my problem is and find out whether they have the evidence. If they do not have, then there is nothing to talk about in terms of the suspension." Adding, "On my side, there are issues that I can only call petty rumours, where a section of the board, whose time is up, think that I am siding with particular members of MCSK [to oust them in an election]. But all that was based on rumours, and that is why I was sent on compulsory leave. I am on suspension; this is my third month. I am looking forward to seeing what is going to happen." On Friday, justices RN Sitati, DS Majanja and TW Cherere gave the MCSK 30 days to comply. “The accounts shall be delivered to the Kenya Copyright Board, which shall be at liberty to issue any further orders and directions,” they said. “There is evidence that the MCSK was collecting royalties, despite the fact that its licence had expired.” The judges said the copyright board is free to call for new applications for collection. Simiyu said, "I am the custodian. I will make an effort to reach the chairman within those 30 days. Within that period, I will look to see if I can come and submit the reports."
