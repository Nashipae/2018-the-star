Mandera assembly on Thursday started vetting afresh nine executive members, 10 months after rejecting a previous list. The county has gone for months without a legally constituted executive. Governor Ali Roba pledged to present the same list to the assembly again. Assembly speaker Aden Khalif told the Star on the phone that the process will be concluded on Saturday. Then the committee will table the report in the house for approval, he said. MCAs who spoke to the Star said they will pass the list without objection and drama. Most of the MCAs from the opposing camps of Jubilee and EFP have put aside their differences and are working together. “I can confirm to you the tension that was there before is no longer there. The members are now cooler and working in harmony even if they disagree on issues,” speaker Khalif said. Early this year, the speaker urged members to comport themselves with decorum or the assembly would punish those who misbehave. Last September, the MCAs shouted, wrestled, whistled and did all they could to disrupt the proceedings. Some had their clothes torn in the scuffle but the list was tabled. Immediately the vetting committee rejected the nominees, citing integrity issues and lack of suitability for their dockets. During another chaotic session last September, chairs were broken and the clothes of some MCAs torn. Representatives from the Economic Freedom Party who opposed the list said that they would not allow Governor Roba to use the house to rubber-stamp his choices. The rejected nominees were Izzudin Abdullahi, Mohamed Ali, Suleikha Harun, Mohamed Adan, Ahmed Sheikh, Abdiaziz Sheikh, Johara Mohamed, Aden Hussein, Shamsa Mohamed and Ibrahim Barrow. But in the new list tabled yesterday, three nominees who were previously rejected were replaced.
