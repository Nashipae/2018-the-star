The 2019 Enterprise and Mwamba Cup tournaments have been expanded to accommodate 32 teams each. Traditionally, the Enterprise Cup was strictly a Kenya Cup affair but will now include 12 KRU Championship sides and eight from the Nationwide. The dates of the competition have also been changed. The knockout tournament starts immediately upon the completion of the Kenya Cup in May but next year’s competition will start on March 9. KRU Director of fixtures Sylvia Kamau expects a competitive tournament owing to the increased competition. “We will have 32 teams — 12 from Kenya Cup, 12 from the Championship and eight from the nationwide leagues from Enterprise Cup. This will be played within the season to maintain the competitiveness of the competition and also act as a break from the busy Kenya Cup and other leagues.” The semis and final of the same knockout tournament will be played on April 13, 2019, a weekend before the Kenya Cup and Championship Cup enters the pre-quarters. The finals of both events will be played on May 18. Homeboyz are the Enterprise Cup champions. Elsewhere, World Rugby has revealed that the HSBC World Sevens Series 2019 will double up as qualification for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games. The world body, however, didn’t say whether the system used in 2014/15 season would still be in place. “The HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series 2019 will be hotly contested as 15 core men’s teams and 11 core women’s teams compete for the title, and with the series acting as the principal route for qualification for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, it promises to be once again highly competitive,” said World Rugby. In 2015/16 Sevens Series, the top four teams automatically qualified for Rio Olympics 7s while hosts men’s and women’s teams automatically qualified for the events Kenya Sevens missed the 2015 automatic qualification and had to use the 2015 Africa 7s in South Africa as a route to Rio where they beat Zimbabwe 19-17 courtesy of a last minute try by Dennis Ombachi. Kenya Lionesses competed at the Olympics following South Africa’s withdrawal from the games. England, Wales and Scotland competed as Great Britain going ahead to win a silver medal. In Rio 2016, Kenya finished 11th after beating Brazil 24-0. The then Benjamin Ayimba coached side lost all her pool matches going down 31-7 to Great Britain, 28-5 to New Zealand and 31-7 to Japan. That was followed by a 14-12 defeat to Spain in the placing matches.
