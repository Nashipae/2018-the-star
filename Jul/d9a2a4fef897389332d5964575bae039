AFC Leopards legends headline initial membership of the club’s newly formed Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization which was launched on Wednesday night at Railways Club, Nairobi. The club became the second in the country to form a Sacco, behind local adversaries and league champions Gor Mahia. The Sacco targets players, fans, supporters and other stakeholders. The legends include Joe kadenge, JJ Masiga, Aggrey Lukoye, Josphat Murila, Peter Lichungu, Mika Amwayi, Mahmoud Abbas, Dan Shikanda, Peter Ouma, Patrick Shilasi, Justus Muhati, Micky Weche, Nahashon Bushuru, Omar Shaban, Ali Kusimba, Nicholas Muyoti and Reginald Asibwa. Sacco chairman, Maurice Osundwa said the minimum monthly remittance for members will be Sh500. “AFC Leopards Sacco members will be able to access business credit, emergency, school fees and personal loans. In addition, the Sacco will work closely with the club (AFC Leopards SC) leadership and all stakeholders to initiate several investment projects. We have to hold hands together to improve the financial security of footballers and stakeholders of the game,” said Osundwa. According to Osundwa, his organization will also secure medical covers for club legends thus doing away with fundraisers during their hour of need. Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa lauded the entire AFC Leopards community for bringing to reality the Sacco movement and called for integrity, transparency and accountability after donating Sh1m. In absentia, COTU chief Francis Atwoli sent Sh300,000 while speaker of the Senate Kenneth Lusaka, Westlands Legislator Timothy Wanyonyi and former Football Kenya Federation boss Sam Nyamweya contributed Sh100,000 each. Busia Governor Sospeter Ojamong gave Sh50,000 where Sh1.65m was realised.
