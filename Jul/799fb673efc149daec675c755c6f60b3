In the last few days, “media shockwaves” have gone global, following the terrible loss of eight black rhinos in a KWS translocation from the Nairobi National Park to Tsavo East National Park. Many concerned, caring people are wondering how such a terrible incident could even happen when the black rhinos were supposed to be in the good hands of the KWS. Many media articles are reporting that it is possible that the water was to salty, therefore causing the mass death of eight precious priceless black rhino. Many people are stating that they find this reason hard to believe, and are asking many questions about basic wildlife management. For example, “Surely the water was properly tested before even deciding to capture and relocate the black rhino?” It has been reported by the media that a full national and international independent investigation into the tragic deaths of the rhino is ongoing, with a full report to be released as soon as possible. It is simply mind-numbing to think that the death of eight black rhino while in the protection of KWS actually happened. Even evil poachers do not succeed in mass killing eight black rhino at the same time. In the wild, black rhino are mostly alone or in small breeding groups and would never naturally be in a large group. A female black rhino normally only has a single calf every two and a half years, with a gestation period of 16 months. The consequences of not taking sufficient and effective action is very grave. Extinction is forever, if protected species like black rhino are no longer found in the wild. Kenya needs to do everything possible to secure and care for their priceless natural treasures, and black rhino are such a priceless treasure.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.
