Police in Embu are pursuing a suspected drug trafficker who escaped after his accomplice was gunned down after attempting to kill an officer who arrested him. County Administration Police commandant Daudi Mohammed and Mbeere South subcounty deputy commissioner Beverly Opwora said the suspect escaped on Wednesday. His colleague Benson Kakai, 36, was shot dead at around 3pm. Kakai pounced on a female AP inspector in Gachuriri village, Mbeere, and pinned her to the ground. He tried to stab her on the head. Mohammed said her juniors fired in the air to scare Kakai before he was shot dead. The other suspect took advantage of the situation and fled into a maize plantation. The commandant said the suspects were found in a rented house and refused to open the door. Officers broke down the door and the slain suspect charged at them with a machete. Mohammed and Opwora said four kilos of bhang and 120 rolls, four knives, four rastafarian flags and Sh4,800 were found in the suspectsâ€™ house. They said the suspects have been on police radar for some time after learning there was a syndicate of bhang trafficking. They said the drugs were sold to students. Mohammed said they are pursuing the mastermind, who contested a seat in the last general election. Police said they would not rest until they catch the escapee and their leader.
