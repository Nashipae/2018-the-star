The government plans to introduce a single uniform for all schools countrywide. Last year, then Education CS Fred Matiang’i ordered all schools to paint their buses yellow for better management. Most schools have complied with the directive. Education PS Belio Kipsang said they are in discussion with stakeholders to change the uniform policy for schools to adopt the same colour and fabric. He wants local textile industries like Rivatex in Eldoret to prepare to make the new uniforms once the policy is adopted. Kipsang spoke on Saturday at Rivatex, which is owned by Moi University. He lauded the university for its foresight in the revival of the textile company that had collapsed. “Initially, we thought it would be a training facility for the university, but later on it became a production company. Now it is turning out to be a major economic project for the country,” he said. Kipsang said the government would continue investing more in an institution like Moi University since it plays a critical role in providing manpower to spur economic growth. “We want the educational institutions to play a role in helping us to implement the Big Four agenda as outlined by President Uhuru Kenyatta,” the PS said. At the same time, a Kenya National Union of Teachers official has faulted a proposal by the Teachers Service Commission to sack or demote headteachers whose schools perform poorly in national examinations. Busia Knut organising secretary Mark Oseno told the Star it is illegal and unprofessional because the performance of schools cannot be pegged on the work of principals. He said the commission should stop issuing policies, guidelines and proposals that cannot work. “Headteachers play the role of management. Parents, students ts and even leaders have a bigger role to play in how schools perform,” Oseno said.
