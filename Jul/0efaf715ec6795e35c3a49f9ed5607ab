Team Kenya is ready to conquer the globe as the IAAF World Under-20 championships get underway in Tampere, Finland tomorrow. Rhonex Kipruto launches Kenya’s bid to regain the overall title in the last event of the day, 10, 000m final. Kipruto 18, the African junior cross country title champion will be joined in Kenya’s hunt for glory in the 25-lap race by compatriot Solomon Boit. Kipruto, who produced his biggest splash with an upset 10km victory on the roads through New York’s Central Park in April, clocking a sizzling 27:08 is favourite to clinch the race but faces stiff competition from Ugandan duo of Jacob Kiplimo and Victor Kiplangat. Eritrea will field Abraha Kokob and Robel Sibhatu, who have clocked 28:23.11 and 28:48.72 this season, respectively while Ethiopian hopes will rest with Berihu Aregawi and Olika Adugna, whose 29:36.67 and 29:37.12 bests also came this year. Beatrice Chebet 18, (15:46.97) and Japan based Hellen Ekalale (15:31.66) will lead Robert Ngirisei’s charges in the hunt for gold in the women’s 5,000m. Chebet will be looking to reach the podium after missing out in the 3000m at the World U18 Championships in Nairobi last year where she finished fourth. They face stiff competition from Ethiopia’s Girmawit Gebregziabher who won the African U20 cross country title in Chlef, Algeria – beating both Ekalale and Chebet. . Japan is sending two strong runners Miku Moribayashi (15:31.62 PB) and Tomomi Musembi Takamatsu (15:45.78 PB). Women’s 3, 000m steeplechase defending champion Celliphine Chepteek Chespol also starts her campaign to retain the title with the event’s preliminaries tomorrow. Chepsol with a personal best of 8:58.78, the second fastest in history is favorite to win gold in the event which Kenya has dominated for several years. Mercy Chepkurui is the only other U20 athlete below 9:30 this year is also expected to easily make it to the next round. Justus Soget and George Manangoi will also be in action in the preliminary rounds of the 1500m where they are expected to sail easily to the next round. Also in action tomorrow will be the World Under 18 400m silver medalist Mary Moraa aka Kisii Express. Before departing for Tampere, Moraa said: “I am going for nothing less than a gold medal. I’m in good shape, better than during the World Under 18.” Jackline Wambui will take part in the 800m heats.
