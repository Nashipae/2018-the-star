Kisii county next month will host the sixth edition of the Kenya Inter-County Sports and Cultural Association Games. The event will take place from August 12-18. Governor James Ongwae said more than 8,000 guests are expected at the week-long sports and cultural extravaganza. The governor sought to allay fears of inadequate accommodation. “We have adequate bed capacity to host the guests. We have mapped existing facilities and developed a hospitality guide for our website to guide visitors on accommodation and transport,” Ongwae said. He urged residents to adopt the homestay approach to accommodate guests. Ongwae said Kisii town has been given a major facelift ahead of the games. “Kisii is a busy commercial hub in Nyanza. We have pedestrian walkways, opened backstreets and paved them with Cabro. We have contracted youth groups to undertake regular cleanup and beautification,” he said. Tourist destination Ongwae assured visitors of safety, saying they are working with county commissioner Godfrey Kigochi and county police chief Abdi Hassan. Recently, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i praised Kigochi and Hassan for reducing crime in Kisii. “Since the two were posted here, of crime has gone down,” the CS said. Ongwae said the county is positioning itself as a tourist destination. Kisii is home to soapstone, Traditional African Rock Art sites at Sameta Hill and Gotichaki and a number of waterfalls, such as Mosora and Nyakwana along River Gucha. On Sunday, Kisii County Hotel Managers secretary Michael Otieno said they are ready to host the guests. “This is an opportunity of lifetime. In Kisii we have about 6,000 rooms, but if they are not enough, we can arrange with our colleagues in Oyugis, Nyamira, Kilgoris, Keroka and Sotik towns,” he told reporters. Otieno said hoteliers will also step up their security. He said they met the county security team and agreed all guests booked in hotels must produce their national IDs.
