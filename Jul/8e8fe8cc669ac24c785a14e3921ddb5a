Residents of Kiboino in Baringo Central are living in fear after stray leopards killed 39 sheep and goats on Tuesday and Wednesday night. "They entered one homestead after another for 15 farmers tearing to death 22 goats and 17 sheep at Kiboino and Oinobmoi villages," area chief Ben Chemjor said. A farmer Simon Kiptegen said he was shocked to find all his 17 sheep and goats lying dead. "I am finished. This used to be my only source of livelihood and I now wonder where to run to pay my children school fees and meet my family basic needs," he said adding that only two goats survived. Another farmer Jonathan Kipchumba from Oinobmoi said he lost his two goats and three sheep. "The leopards also attacked last year killing 20 goats in our village," Kipchumba said urging the Kenya Wildlife Service(KWS) officers to capture the animals. He said stray wild animals also pose a danger to the residents especially school-going children. The cats may have escaped from the nearby Rimoi Game Reserve in the neighbouring Elgeyo-Marakwet County. However, Senior Baringo KWS warden Dickson Too regretted the incident saying he received the information on Wednesday morning. "We will lay traps to capture the animals so they can be transported back to the game reserve," he said.
