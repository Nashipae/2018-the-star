The woman who fled Dubai after allegedly stealing Sh140 million will be detained 14 more days for police to complete investigations. Milimani Principal Magistrate Benson Nzakyo gave the order on Friday after senior state counsel Lindrey Mugambi made an application. Mugambi noted that the investigators intend to travel to Tanzania to arrest more suspects. She said the prosecution had relied on a sworn affidavit by Nairobi DCI officer Emmanuel Ngetich who took suspect Rebecca Musau to court. The magistrate granted the prosecution's request after dismissing an objection by the defence team, which had told the court that there were no compelling reasons for Musau's continued detention. Ngetich said in the affidavit that the suspect was arrested on Tuesday night while trying to cross into Tanzania via Namanga border. Musau and several other people reportedly left Dubai on March 4 with money stolen from a car in transit belonging to a company named Tranguard. The vehicle is said to have been on its way to Dierra city mall in Dubai for the refilling of an ATM machine. Police went for Musau after the Inspector General of Police received a letter from the Foreign Affairs ministry on May 15. The investigator said the suspect was interrogated and escorted to her residence in Kamulu where a search was conducted and Sh13,130,000 million found. She could not account for the money. The suspect was then remanded at Muthaiga police station ahead of today's ruling on the request for more time for the probe. Ngetich said police were looking into several other allegations raised against Musau. The case will be mention on July 20 for further direction. Click here for the latest political news
