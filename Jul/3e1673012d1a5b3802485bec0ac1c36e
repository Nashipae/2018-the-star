Former Saboti CDF manager Joshua Orina's killers have asked the court to grant them a non-custodial sentence. Nahashon Omondi told the court, through his lawyer Karani Grey, that he has reformed and is now a church deacon. This came even as the Kitale High court ordered a probation report on the case. On Tuesday, the court ruled that Omondi and his co-accused Kenneth Barasa were guilty as charged. Justice Hillary Chemitei held that evidence in court showed that the two killed Orina on March 19, 2008, at Nzoia Sugar Company in Bungoma East.

Omondi, a husband and a father of seven, asked the court to grant his prayer to enable him to work and provide for the family. "Incarcerating him will cause suffering of the family especially the children who might drop out of school," the lawyer said. Lawyer Dennis Wanyama, for Barasa, also asked the court to give his client a non-custodial sentence. He cited the grounds that the accused has already served a long time in remand. "Barasa's wife is six months' pregnant, the family has had a difficult time when my client was remanded, a non-custodial sentence will help him provide for his family," the lawyer said. He also pointed out that the accused is remorseful, has reformed, and goes to church. On his side, state prosecutor Edward Kakoi asked the court to decline the request saying Orina had a young family which is suffering because of the action of his killers. Justice Chemitei ordered a probation report to be submitted on or before July 31, the same day when he will give a ruling on the matter. Click here for the latest political news
