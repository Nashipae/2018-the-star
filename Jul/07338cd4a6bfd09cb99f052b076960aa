A blacklisted company was allowed to import duty-free sugar, MPs heard yesterday. The joint Agriculture and Trade Committee co-chaired by Kieni MP Kanini Kega and Mandera South's Adan Haji was told that Hydrey P Limited was blacklisted by the eleventh Parliament in 2013. Hydrey P Limited MD Naushad Merali said he was not aware of the blacklisting.

Last year, the company imported 35,000 tonnes of brown sugar from Brazil. Merali said the importation was legal. He said his consignment met the required standards and was approved by the Kenya Bureau of Standards. The committee is investigating the importation of poisonous sugar by unscrupulous traders. "It is unfair that all sugar dealers have been victimised and their warehouses sealed following claims of mercury in the consignment," Merali told the team. He said he was losing money because he cannot sell his sugar. "I urge you to quickly settle this matter," Merali said. Read: What lab tests say about metals found in brown sugar Click here for
