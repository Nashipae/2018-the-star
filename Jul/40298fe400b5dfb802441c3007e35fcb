There are no divisions in the Jubilee Party, Deputy President William Ruto has said. Ruto said on Saturday that the government is working well and his working relationship with President Uhuru Kenyatta is close. He was speaking at Gaturi Primary School during a homecoming party for Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro. About 30 Jubilee MPs attended. Ruto said all development projects are being implemented after consultations between him and the President. He urged Kenyans to ignore claims of divisions in the ruling party. Claims of inflighting have emerged following the divisive Mau Forest evictions and claims that the Mt Kenya bloc are not ready to back Ruto for President in 2022. “We are all working as a team, knowing that the Jubilee government rose to power in 2013 through the overwhelming support of Kenyans,” Ruto said.
