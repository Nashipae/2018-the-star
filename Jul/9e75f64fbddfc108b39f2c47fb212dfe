Authorities in Kibwezi are searching for a primary school teacher who fled after allegedly defiling a Standard 8 pupil. Makani Primary School head teacher Jacob Katambo said the teacher has been absent without notice for two days. Yesterday, parents demonstrated at the school and threatened to withdraw their children in order to force arrest of the teacher. They demanded the transfer of the head teacher whom they accused of protecting the teacher. “Our daughters are not safe anymore. He should have handed the teacher to police when they reported the case last Wednesday,”a parent said. Kibwezi police boss Ben Changulo said they are hunting for the teacher. Officials of the subcounty Teacher’s Service Commission declined to comment. The reported victim, a 15-year-old girl, was among those being questioned when the Star visited the school yesterday. Her father said his daughter would sometimes arrive home, then return to school to “collect a book or something else”. I didn’t suspect anything until the case was reported by her schoolmates after she was found in a compromising position with the teacher,” he said. He pleaded with law enforcers to ensure justice for his daughter. On Tuesday, subcounty director of education Kennedy Machora went door to door meeting students and describing the anti-defilement committee of security agents, teachers and administrators. Machora said the teacher will be arrested and charged in court. “My office is investigating with the help of security agents,” he said. Kibwezi deputy county commissioner Patrick Moriela warned students against involving themselves in crime.
