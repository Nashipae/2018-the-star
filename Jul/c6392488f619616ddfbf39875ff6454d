Former Citizen TV anchor Janet Mbugua is gearing up to be a second-time mum with Edward Ndichu. She is pregnant with her second child, and in her vlog, she discussed breaking the news to their son, Huru, as a family. "We speak to him like an adult and he has really become independent, which is helping him a lot. We have also made sure that when he asks a question, we try as much as possible to explain to him about that," Janet said. The couple want their son to be knowledgeable about his soon-to-arrive sibling. "Huru has totally changed, especially after we explained to him about it. I noticed that there is a difference and he constantly wanted to be with me. I tried and explained to him so that he does not get too shocked. Although I was told that the transition would be a bit tricky, and that in the first few months there may be a little bit of jealousy. So what I should do is include him in washing the baby and even changing her diapers."
