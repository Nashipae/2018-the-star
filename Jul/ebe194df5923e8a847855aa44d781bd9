In the past few months, there has been a spate of workplace changes by leading media personalities. Former TV news anchor Anne Ngugi's advice to journalists is to be driven by passion and not money. "Those [transitions] are more of individual decisions that different people make in life, based on different perspectives. Some go for money, while others go for exposure or even because they want to follow people," she said. "To the individual journalist, just know your reason for moving to the next place." Having worked so long in different media houses, she says her experience has taught her that money can deceive a person. "I have come to realise that neither money nor fame can make you a better journalist, but passion can. Make sure you are going for knowledge, and try to identifying yourself with a media house that is believable to be good, more than looking for the money that you will scoop from them, although we are in different journeys in this field," she said. "Once you start moving because everyone is moving, you will end up losing your identity, and you may even find out that you are empty without achieving any goal." Ann Ngugi is currently working at BBC after being away from media, where she is working as a reporter and a radio presenter. Earlier on, she worked at Mediamax, where she was sacked â€” an experience she says she never imagined could happen because she believes she was competent enough in her work. She has since moved on and is content with her new workplace, saying the past was a learning experience to her career.
