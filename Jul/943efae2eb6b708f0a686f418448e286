Banks have opposed Treasury’s new tax on money transfers. The Kenya Bankers Association yesterday moved to court seeking to revoke the new tax which charges 0.05 percent on transfers made by banks, their agencies and other financial institutions above Sh500,000. The association, in an urgent application said the introduction of the “Robinhood tax” by Treasury CS Henry Rotich in his June 14 budget is not only unlawful, but unreasonable. “There is ambiguity and lack of clarity in terms of which duty is imposed, in that there is no definition of what constitutes “money transferred by banks” KBA argues. It also contends the new directive fails to comply with the requirement of the provisional Collection of Taxes and Duties Act. The association said the new levy ought to have been published before it was imposed by the CS. The association said for its members to comply, they will require to reconfigure their computer systems which can take up to two months. Lawyer Kenneth Alison Franser wants the court to issue an order stopping the implementation of the Finance Bill 2018 until proper mechanisms are in place. The association further argues there was no public participation prior to the introduction of the new duty contrary to the constitutional requirement. “We will find it extremely difficult, if not impossible to carry out transactions over Sh5000,000 from today with disruption of business for customers and damage of the economy.” It said the duty will significantly hurt Vision 2030 aspirations due to the unattractiveness of cost of carrying out transactions in Kenya.
