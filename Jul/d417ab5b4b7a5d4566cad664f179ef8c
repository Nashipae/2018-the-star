The first patient to undergo a kidney transplant at Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital was buried on his parents’ farm in Kivwe village on Saturday. Antony Ndwiga, 30, died on June 22 at 5pm after the transplant the previous day. He was a former teacher at Karurumo Primary School. Embu Health  executive Jamleck Muturi and Health chief officer Grace Muriithi who attended the emotional burial termed his death as unfortunate.  They said the hospital tried its best to save his life through the pioneer surgery. Muturi, who spoke publicly for the first time since Ndwiga’s death, said the transplant was a success. However, Ndwiga developed complications and was admitted to the ICU. His brother Moses Muriithi donated the kidney a day before the operation. Doctors who performed the procedure said they struggled for at least six hours to find Ndwiga’s blood vessels that were too thin. Renal surgeon Phillip Cheptinga said because of the narrow veins, the blood pumped to the kidney was inadequate. Ndwiga’s family and colleagues descibed him as humble and hardworking. His parents were Silverster Nyaga and Juliana Wanja. He married Purity Wanyaga in 2015. They have a daughter aged three.
