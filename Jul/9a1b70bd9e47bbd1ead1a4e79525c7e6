Britain’s Tullow Oil yesterday said it might be forced to shut down operations at its northern Kenyan oilfields if it cannot reach a deal to end protests. The blockade by the local community has disrupted activities of trucking oil. The protests, which began on June 27, interrupted a trucking scheme that aims to transport about 2,000 barrels per day of crude from the fields to the Coast. The pilot scheme was launched in June. The oil is being used to test flow rates and other technical issues before the firm starts full production and before Kenya starts oil exports via a pipeline to the Coast. The pipeline is due to be constructed by 2022. The production area in Turkana region has long been plagued by banditry and cattle rustling. Turkana also lies near South Sudan, a nation torn by years of conflict. “It is vital that our return to work in Kenya has the backing and support of the government, Turkana leadership and the community. We are working hard on reaching an agreement that will make sure that our operations will not be interrupted in the future,” Tullow Kenya managing director Martin Mbogo said. “Discussions are ongoing, and we are optimistic we will be able to start crude oil trucking again soon.” However, he said essential supplies needed to run production would run out in the next 14 days, after which we will have no option other than a complete shutdown of the camp. The company said it had reduced its staff at the site due to unrest that had interrupted operations. When asked about Tullow’s statement, officials at the Ministry of Petroleum and Mining did not comment.The protesters are demanding the deployment of more security forces, the Kenyan media has said. Tullow has said the Amosing and Ngamia onshore fields have estimated contingent resources of about 560 million barrels, with plateau production potentially reaching 100,000 barrels per day.
