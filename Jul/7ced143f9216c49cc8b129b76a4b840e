On Friday, the Star reported about a court case between Kenya Airways and its agent in Angola over an alleged $6million (Sh600 million) ticket scam. The story quoted a Luanda-based daily newspaper, Valor, which had reported that Grupo Belchix is suing Kenya Airways for billing the agency for counterfeit ticket sales by its staff. The parallel ticketing was allegedly done without the knowledge of the agency. Valor had reported that an internal audit had adversely mentioned KQ’s former regional director for Africa, Rosemary Adogo, and her assistant Caroline Dunask. However, an audit report of KQ operations in Angola for the period ended September 30, 2013, seen by the Star does not mention the two officials whatsoever. The audit instead implicates Fuchi Critovao, then KQ sales executive in Luanda, for occasionally issuing tickets to passengers. “It is not company practice for sales executives to issue tickets on behalf of General Sales Agent (GSA). Tickets were issued outside normal working hours of GSA,” the audit report found. According to the report, the sales and station manager confirmed that Critovao would from time to time be assisted to issue tickets by a former KQ employee, William Omondi, who was dismissed. The audit could not however establish whether Omondi had access to the reservation system. The Star regrets any embarrassment the story may have caused Ms Adogo and Caroline Dunask.
