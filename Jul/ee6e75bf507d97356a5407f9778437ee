Governor Mike Sonko has directed that all public toilets in Nairobi be free. Sonko said ii was unfair to charge residents for using the public facilities. The county collects about Sh6.2 million annually from the toilets. Nairobi has at least 68 public toilets, 17 are located in the central business district. Last year in January, Nairobi resident Adrian Kamotho asked the High Court to order the county government to scrap the charges. Sonko spoke at Charter Hall yesterday where he launched a Sh357 million bursary for 70,000 poor but bright students. The governor said his administration would increase bursary funds by Sh500,000 yearly in order for more needy children to get an education. All the 85 elected MCAs each received Sh3.5 million for their wards. Sonko said the previous administration began a bursary scheme, but was not fully committed to it. "Ï ordered an audit of the bursary scheme. Students with genuine cases are now getting cash," he said. Education executive Janet Ouko commended MCAs for following up on bursaries despite the delay. “We have encountered major challenges resulting in a delay. Education is a priority for the county government. We expect improved performance," she said. Education Committee chairperson Millicent Mugadi urged parents to ensure their children attend school. "As a committee we have had many challenges but we are happy that children within our county will continue learning because of the bursaries," said Mugadi. The executive also issued out their share bursaries where by1000 children who joined form one this year were fully paid for sh53,000 each worth school fees for a full year.
