Former beauty queen Rachel Matete, who is based in Los Angeles, has exposed some male gospel artistes for being "fakes", "hypocrites" and "sex pests". In a series of posts, Rachel exposes two male artistes she has been in contact with, who she says left a bad taste in her mouth. One is a popular gospel producer who expected her to foot his hotel and entertainment bills when he visited Los Angeles. "Over at Guitar Center in West Hollywood, he gleefully picks out the best quality equipment that we’ll need. "At this point I should mention that I had told him about my work situation hoping he’d have the decency to quit trying to make me pay for his over entitled advantage taking azz because my boyfriend had just about had it with me and this whole scenario. I’d never financed anything for a man I love, let alone a strange man I can barely stand. Nevertheless, he had no qualms making me pay for everything so I was going to get him back at Guitar Center. Once at the counter, the equipment comes out to almost $5,000. I then hit him with a “you go ahead and pay I’ll go bring the car upfront” and bolt out. He’s left standing there with an “oh sh*t” look on his face." Another one was a randy gospel star who is known for his flashy lifestyle. "He offered to have me flown from Mombasa to Nairobi in “one of” HIS choppers and generously offered me accommodation in one of his lavish mansions...Try to impress with “stuff” that I highly doubt he owns. Where’s the Christian humility he sings about though?"
