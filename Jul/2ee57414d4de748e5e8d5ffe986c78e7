Machakos Woman Representative Joyce Kamene has said appealed to courts to deny suspected rapists bail. She said punitive penalties should be imposed on those guilty of rape so as to discourage the crime. "I am appealing to the government that rapists should not be released on bond if arrested," Kamene said on Thursday. She said the bonds should be increased to Sh10 million so that the suspects do not afford the same to serve as a lesson to others. Kamene said jail terms for such culprits should also be increased to minimise chances of the culprits getting out of prison. Section 3 (3) of the Sexual Offences Act states that a person guilty of rape is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may be enhanced to imprisonment for life. She said girls develop fear once defiled with some failing to get married when they become of age. The county MP addressed the press at Kyangala Girls Secondary School in Kalama sub-county on Thursday. She launched a sanitary towels distribution program to public primary and secondary schools in the county. Kamene visited Mavoko, Machakos and Kalama sub counties launching the program on Thursday. "I am ready to fight for the rights of a girl child in Machakos county," Kamene said. Click here for the latest political news
