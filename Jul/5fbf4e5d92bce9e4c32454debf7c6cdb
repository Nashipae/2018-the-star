At least 300 fishermen in Lamu have been given Mvuvi cards for easy identification by security personnel in the Indian Ocean. The cards will end constant harassment by Maritime police. The cards, given by the national government, contains the fishermen's ID numbers, a special serial number and their respective beaches. Lamu deputy county commissioner Loius Rono issued the cards at the Mwana Arafa hotel on Friday. Some 4,500 fishermen are expected to be issued with the cards. "Today was the second phase following the April launch. It will continue until all fishermen receive their cards," Rono said.
