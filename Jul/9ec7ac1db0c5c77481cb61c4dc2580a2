Two people on Monday appeared in a Kigumo court on charges of assaulting a journalist. Peter Irungu and Joseph Otieno were accused of assaulting Dennis Kabiru, a Royal Media Services cameraman, on July 20 at Elite Girls Academy in Maragua town. They also faced charges of theft and causing malicious damage to his camera. The two pleaded not guilty before senior resident magistrate Agnes Mwangi, who ordered them to pay Sh70,000 bond each for release. The case will be mentioned on August 6. Kabiru said, “We were talking to the parents when youths charged at us, but my colleagues were able to run to safety.” The parents were complaining about the school asking them to pay Sh3,000 after their children walked out of the school two weeks ago. The parents demanded to know why they were being charged yet the students had not caused any damage. The parents said the charges ranged from Sh1,500 to Sh 3,000 depending on the class of individual students. The three journalists found the parents outside the school with their children as the gate had been closed. The parents complained that the school management had not informed them of the charges in advance and accused them of failing to address them when they arrived. Kabiru afterwards recorded a statement at Maragua police station and received treatment at Maragua Subdistrict Hospital after sustaining minor injuries. Elite Group of Schools director Elisha Ndung’u is expected in court today.
