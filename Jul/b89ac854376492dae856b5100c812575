Experienced Kenyan international Terry Juma’s 24th minute goal is all Telkom needed to silence rivals Strathmore University Scorpions 1-0 at City Park. However, the game would have ended 2-0 as the match day umpires Tina Agunda and Paul Mutuku unanimously admitted to have wrongly disallowed Jacky Mwangi’s 44th minute goal—leading to a four-minute delay as Telkom players and the technical bench protested the decision to cancel it. Mwangi had drilled in a hard shot in the area but poor positioning by the officials adjudged that the ball was struck off the area to warrant a goal kick for a goal. Prior to the game, the two sides were enjoying unbeaten runs in the league after winning their past five matches but Juma’s strike took her side’s tally to 18 points. Scorpions, touted as the team to break Telkom’s dominance in the league, watched as Telkom bagged the three points despite neutralising their usual attack style of play and holding the lethal trio of Mwangi, Audrey Omaido and Maureen Okumu. Telkom goalkeeper Cynthia Onyango produced several saves to save her side from conceding the third goal of the season. The Kenyan international who was guilty of fouling Scorpion’s playmaker Gilly Okumu in the area for a penalty stroke in the 18th minute stood tall to deny the latter from converting from the spot. Okumu had dispossessed last man Lucy Lichuma and was bound to put her side ahead but an on rushing Onyango scythed her down for a penalty stroke.
