Celebrated American actor, director and producer Tony Goldwyn and acclaimed writer Jamal Joseph arrived in the country on Sunday afternoon to start work on a film about Kenyan philanthropists Jessica and Kennedy Odede. Tony played the role of American president Fitzgerald Grant III in the popular TV series Scandal. Now he is in the country for a completely different role, that of producer and director. Tony and Jamal are in the country to begin the process of turning Jessica and Kennedy's best-selling book titled 'Find Me Unafraid' into a film.Â They hope to shoot the film in Kenya, given the many restrictions and bottlenecks bedevilling the industry.
