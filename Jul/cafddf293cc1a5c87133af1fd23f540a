Fifteen chief officers in Baringo took office on Wednesday after the High Court in Nakuru temporarily lifted an order blocking their hiring last month. The Nakuru Labour Relations and Industrial Court granted the order on July 2 pending determination of their case. They are going through induction, a director at the county office told the Star yesterday. On Saturday, Governor Stanley Kiptis said the officers are free to serve. He spoke during Ushirika Day celebrations at Boresha Sacco in Eldama-Ravine. “My government has been straining without chief officers, but thank God our prayers have been answered. We are now a full house,” Kiptis said. He said the people who sued were jealous. Kiptis said they want to frustrate their work.
