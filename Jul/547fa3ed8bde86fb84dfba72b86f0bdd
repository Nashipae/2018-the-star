The government has started probing allegations of discrimination against Kenyans working at the Standard gauge Railway. Transport CS James Macharia yesterday told the National Assembly's Roads and Transportation Committee that a report will be ready in two weeks. "The ministry does not condone discrimination and oppression of local staff. We have directed Kenya Railways to carry out investigations to establish the authenticity of the claims. Anyone is found culpable will face the full force of the law," Macharia said. Kenya Railways has already commissioned an employee satisfaction and work environment survey on local staff, he said. "The findings are intended to elicit intervention measures to address identified areas of concerns," the CS told the team chaired by Pokot South MP David Pkosing. Macharia dismissed claims that SGR was operating at a loss saying Kenya Railways is accumulating sound reserves towards payment of the debt sourced to finance the Mombasa-Nairobi-Naivasha line. He said the Sh1 billion being paid to the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) as operation cost is generated from the business and not from Treasury. He said the SGR was already making profits and will have sufficient funds to repay the loan by 2022. “We are not disputing the Sh1 billion operation cost paid monthly, but we are currently making an average revenue of Sh2.2 billion. The revenue will because we are increasing the number of trains,” Macharia said. He added: “We are accumulating reserves to pay our debt from 2020, and I can guarantee that the same will be paid purely from the revenue generated from the SGR. No money will be used from the Railways Development Fund will be spent in the loan repayment'.
