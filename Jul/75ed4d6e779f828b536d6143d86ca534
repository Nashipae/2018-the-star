Former US President Obama is expected to come to Kenya this month, where he will meet President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga. When in Kenya, he will travel to Alego for the inauguration of the Sauti Kuu Foundation’s Sports, Resource and Vocational Training Centre, and deliver brief opening remarks. The day will be marked by festive ceremony, entertainment, and the unveiling of global standard sport facilities, a first in the region, with world-class athletes in attendance. The facilities include an international standard size football pitch, a basketball court, and a volleyball/netball court, a library, IT lab and vocational centre. Due to space constraints, the public’s access to the event will be restricted, and the event will be open to a limited number of credentialed media.
