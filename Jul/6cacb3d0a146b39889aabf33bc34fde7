Busia governor Sospeter Ojaamong has asked leaders to work together to develop the county. The governor has lately been accused of ethnic bias in the redeployment of staff. The accusations were made by former Funyula MP Paul Otuoma. Ojaamong beat Otuoma in last year’s election. The governor on Saturday said election battles ended when the High Court upheld his victory. “Leaders should come together and deliver for the people of Busia. Empty rhetoric will not take us anywhere,” Ojaamong said. He spoke during the burial of his uncle Baranabas Okoit, 93, in Akwobait village in Teso South. Ojaamong said his cabinet was inclusive and that he had not received complaints from any quarters.
