We observed a large herd of buffalo drinking at the Athi dam. I was fascinated by the presence of many of red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers. We sat quietly as the oxpeckers moved all over the buffalo, looking for parasitic snacks, like ticks and lice. A close ecological relationship involving two or more species that can benefit all parties is known as symbiotic mutualism. When a symbiotic relationship benefits one party without affecting the others, it is called commensalism. And when helping one while harming the others, it is called parasitism. The relationship between the buffalo and the tickbird hovers somewhere between mutualism and parasitism because the tickbird seems to derive greater benefit from the relationship than the buffalo. Red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers have long been thought to remove ticks from their hosts to the benefit of both: the bird eats the ticks, and the host is relieved of blood-sucking, disease-carrying parasites. However, oxpeckers can also bore aggressively into animals to access blood, causing small, open wounds. A secondary benefit to a host from the tickbird’s presence is a sort of early warning system, since the birds make a hissing sound if they sight an enemy. But are oxpeckers actually their true symbiotic “friends”, or are buffalo and other species merely a moving, living feast of warm blood for oxpeckers? I believe oxpeckers definitely have a high nutritional benefit from species like buffalo, giraffe and many other herbivores. So in my opinion, it is more of a feathered feast than a friendship. So next time you are in the park, be on the lookout for species that have symbiotic relationships.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.  For more information, visit www.kws.org or  or www.nairobigreenline.com or on Facebook at Nairobi National Park
