All but one of the 19 Kenya Power managers have been released from police custody after posting Sh1 million bail each as ordered by the court on Tuesday. Former MD Ben Chumo was the first to leave the Gigiri Police station Wednesday morning while the rest got out as the day progressed. By late afternoon Wednesday, only one of the suspects had not complied with the requirements of bail set by the court. They were each required to pay a Sh 1 Million cash bail or alternatively deposit a Sh 2 Million and a personal bond of Sh3 Million. They were also ordered to deposit their travel documents and also appear at the DCI after every two weeks. The suspects were all remanded at Gigiri police station on Tuesday evening to allow them to pay the bail failure to which they were to be transferred to Industrial Area Remand Prison and Langata Women’s prisons. This was because, by the time the court was making the ruling, banks and the court registry had been closed. In his bail ruling, Anti-Corruption Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti had also cautioned the suspended top chiefs against contacting any of the witnesses in the case, failure to which their bond terms will be cancelled. They were further restrained from approaching any of the Kenya Power installation offices or interfere with the company’s system using their passwords. The court has also issued summons against two MUWA Ltd Co-directors, Grace Wanjira and John Mungai who are said to be in the UK on medical grounds. The case will be mentioned on August 6 for pre-trial. Also read; KPLC bosses granted bail, travel documents confisticated Click here for the latest political news
