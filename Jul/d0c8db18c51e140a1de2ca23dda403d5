KBC TV News anchor Kaltun Jama has left the station less than two months after she started anchoring its weekend Kiswahili bulletin, Darubini Wikendi. Kaltun is heading to NTV, where she is set to replace Jamila Mohamed, who left for Citizen TV. Kaltun, who has worked with the state broadcaster as a reporter for more than two years, was introduced to the screens by former KBC News anchor Roncliffe Odit. Odit has since left KBC and headed to BBC Swahili, where he is a producer and presenter for its flagship programme, Dira ya Dunia. He told Word Is, "From the day we did our first bulletin together, I knew she was destined for greatness. Kaltun was hardworking and very committed to her work. She was ready to learn and I enjoyed working with her. I wish her all the best in her new ventures." Kaltun earlier worked with Radio Salaam in Mombasa. Sources say she resigned from KBC this past Friday and was set to join NTV yesterday. She told Word Is she is super excited about her new place of work. "It is good and a great opportunity that I have got. I hope to learn new and better things from there. At the same time, I expect new challenges but I will do my best and the rest will follow. I am also ready to work with my new colleagues," she said. "To my fans, we shall still be meeting at NTV. For those I have worked with, I am happy to have worked with different people at KBC. Some have helped me at a personal level, for which I am grateful, and may God bless them all."
