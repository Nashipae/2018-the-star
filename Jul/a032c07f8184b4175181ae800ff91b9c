J blessing has been linked to many women. These include radio presenter Mwende Macharia, singer Chantelle, whose child with him died, and most recently, Avril. Now he is set to have a hush-hush wedding with a mystery babe, who is said to be a model. The wedding plans are underway, with the music producer sending "save the date" messages to his close buddies in the industry. The date for the wedding is rumoured to be in August. So we reached out to J Blessing. His response was as cold as an icebox. "If someone wants to talk about themselves, they will talk about themselves, or even call you to tell you about them and what to publish. So wait till that time I will want to talk about myself, I call and ask for the interview myself," he said. J Blessings then went on a long tirade, ranting about wanting to keep his private affairs and life away from the limelight. "You know me as a video director and not a celebrity because I don't sing and I am not your friend," he said. "I do not advertise myself because I am not a politician or a singer." Adding, "You asking me about my wedding does not make sense because like I said, you are not my friend. And if I want to publicise myself, I have channels like YouTube and Facebook. Na nikitaka kuanika kitu, nitaanika na niseme. This is what I am doing. I do not need the media to publicise myself. If I need it, I will call the relevant people and tell them to write that about me."
