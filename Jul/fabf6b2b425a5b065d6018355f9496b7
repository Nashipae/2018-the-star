News presenter Betty Kyallo has quit KTN for K24, a move that has shocked many viewers. Sources said Kyallo resigned from Standard Group earlier and had been serving notice. She is expected to headline news anchoring at K24 which recently lost two business presenters - Zawadi Mudibo and Maya Hayakawa - to BBC. KTN lost prime news presenter and talk show host Yvonne Okwara, Kiswahili reporter Mashirima Kapombe and managing editor Joe Ageyo to Citizen TV. It is not clear why Kyallo quit KTN but insiders at the media house said she was given an irresistible package. The news anchor has been praised for flexibility during interviews as she uses English, Kiswahili and even Sheng. But she has not shied away from controversies that have surrounded matters including her short-lived marriage to NTV anchor Dennis Okari. She has also been in the spotlight due to the fallout with Susan Kaittany of Posh Palace hair and beauty salon, who was her best friend and business partner. News of Kyallo's exit came shortly after KTN crime reporter Dennis Onsaringo resigned to become Taita Taveta county director of communications. Another KTN journalist, Karen Karimi, quit her job to reportedly be with her fiance who is a pilot. Karimi said she was willing to relocate to the Middle East to spend more time with the man. K24 recently poached Royal Media’s top radio talents Felix Odiwuor aka Jalang’o and Jacky Nyaminde alias Wilbroda. Citizen Radio's Joyce Gituro and Francis Luchivya exited to join Mediamax.
