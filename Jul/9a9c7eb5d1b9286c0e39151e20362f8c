Two women and two secondary school students have been arrested in a clampdown of a prostitution ring involving minors in Embu town. The four were arrested at Kiambuthi shopping center where they had converted a rented house into a brothel. The two women have allegedly been cashing in on the trade after introducing the minors into the business. The suspects were held at the Embu police station where they were interrogated. Kamiu assistant chief Samuel Kariuki and the community policing chairman Dedan Gitahi said parents and the school administration complained about the girlâ€™s disappearance. The students are candidates for the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam. Police said about six girls were conducting the business under the tutelage of the women. The girls said they were lured into prostitution by the women. The administrator promised to step up the war against prostitution, saying he will mobilise parents and teachers to be on alert.
