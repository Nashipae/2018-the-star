Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati has assured Webuye and county residents nothing will stop the setting up of an industrial park in the town. The county, through the Ministry of Trade, plans to set up a multimillion-shilling industrial park this financial year at Wananchi area. Residents and local leaders have received the project with mixed reactions, some opposing the process being followed to set up the park. Maraka MCA Majani Mutoka faulted Wangamati, saying local leaders and stakeholders should be involved. Majani, an ODM party MCA, said the process should be open and residents whose houses will be demolished be compensated. During the burial of Mzee Ford Amutala in Webuye town on Saturday, Wangamati said there will be public participation. “We have funds approved in the budget by our MCAs for putting up the industrial park in Webuye. No amount of noise will hinder the project from being implemented,” he said. The governor said first on the programme is a meeting of all Webuye stakeholders, who include elected leaders. “After meeting local leaders, we shall have a meeting with the affected families that face relocation – who stay on the county government land proposed for the industrial park – then we shall have a meeting with residents of Webuye town,” he said. Wangamati said those who legally own property at the proposed site will be compensated, but grabbers should not expect anything. The Ford Kenya governor said when he took office, he knew his biggest challenge would be unemployment.
