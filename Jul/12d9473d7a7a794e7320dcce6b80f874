Homa Bay fishermen led by Beach Management Unit leaders are up in arms against illegal fish cages in Lake Victoria. BMU chairman Edward Oremo said currently, there are over 700 illegal fishing cages in the side of Homa Bay. He said most of the cages are placed on the fish breeding sites and fishing routes by the locals thus leading to dwindling fish production and meagre catch. Speaking during a meeting involving 138 BMU chairmen drawn from the County in Homa Bay Town on Friday, they told the County Executive member in charge of Agriculture Aguko Juma to ensure that a proper audit is done and the legally placed cages are identified. “It is not that we are against the placements of the cages, however, a proper procedure should be followed when placing the cages allowing other fishermen enough space to carry out their activities,” said Oremo.

BMU Network National Chairman Tom Guda said they will not allow more cages to placed in the Lake henceforth.
