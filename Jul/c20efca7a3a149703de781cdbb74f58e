Three Murang'a county workers were arraigned on Tuesday for allegedly stealing HIV testing kits worth Sh3 million. Sophia Kinya, William Muhora, and James Wairiuko were accused of stealing 32,400 kits from Murang'a County Referral Hospital between May 16 and July 13. The suspects are among eight who recorded statements after it was reported on Saturday that the kits were missing. They denied the charge before principal magistrate Anthony Mwichigi and were each released on Sh1 million bond or Sh200,000 bail. The case will be heard on August 2. Chief health officer James Gitau said Murang'a discovered that the kits were missing after Kirinyaga county requested some due a delay in delivery. Gitau reported that only one carton was found in the store and that there were no documents to explain where the rest were. He expressed fear that the theft could be the doing of a cartel that was previously blamed for massive loss of drugs at the hospital, a case that saw patients buy them from private pharmacies.
