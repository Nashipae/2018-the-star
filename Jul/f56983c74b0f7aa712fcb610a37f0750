Detectives from the Department of Criminal Investigations on Friday arrested a Safaricom employee and JKUAT student over SIM card fraud. Maurice Musoti and Rian Obaga Nyagaka - a fourth year JKUAT student of BSc Electronic Engineering are believed to be part of the group of fraudsters who have ripped off Kenyans millions of shillings in prank calls. DCI, in a tweet on Saturday, said they recovered an Apple laptop; 2,160 unused Safaricom SIM cards, 44 used Safaricom SIM cards, and five Agent Till numbers. The two were also found with three Mpesa record books, a router, two mobile phones - a blackberry and Samsung J7. On Friday, Safaricom warned subscribers against fraudsters who steal cash from their Mpesa accounts through SIM swap. Dozens of subscribers have complained of being conned in fraudulent swaps, a situation the telco said can be avoided by keeping Personal Identifiable Information (PIN) secret. "We would like to remind our customers to safeguard information such as SIM and M-Pesa PINs, dates of birth and national ID numbers,‚Äù Nicholas Mulila, director for risk management, said in a statement. A SIM swap requires one to present their ID, SIM PIN, last top-up amount, and the numbers called or received last. The Communication Authority of Kenya has also warned mobile phone users against
disclosing sensitive personal identification information (PIN) to third
