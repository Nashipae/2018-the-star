A project to educate residents about government-sponsored funds has been launched. The BMW Chamadzi project launched in Mikadini ward in Mombasa targets youth and women. MCA Renson Thoya said the ward has partnered with Bandari Sacco. He spoke on Saturday during a joint training of 20 groups on how to access funds. “Beneficiaries will be closely monitored,” Thoya said. Mombasa Devolution official Seth Odongo was present. Thoya said youth are skilled and with access to funds, they have the potential to make great strides. Thoya said beneficiaries should not be discouraged by failure. “Only serious people will strive to achieve,” he said. Noprman Odenge of Bandari Sacco said the project will change lives. The sacco has been in operation for 45 years. Odenge said there is a paradigm shift on how business is being conducted. “Through their savings, members can take loans. The sacco can mobilise deposits for joint ventures on tasks that will benefit all,” Odenge said.
