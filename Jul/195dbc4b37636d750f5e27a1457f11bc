An investigator in a murder case has been ordered to produce an affidavit explaining why he opposes the release of a suspect on bond. State prosecutor Amos Chigiti had told the court the state had very weighty and compelling reasons to deny the accused, Godfrey Kipkemoi, bail. He said officer Joseph Gitau will bring the affidavit today. Kipkemoi, a car dealer in Nakuru CBD, was charged with murder of Rift Valley Institute of Science and Technology lecturer Irene Jepchumba, 25. Jepchumba’s body was found two weeks ago. Kipkemoi was charged on July 20. Police believe the murder took place on July 6 at Choka Falls in Molo River. CUSTODY They have requested the court to allow them to conduct a DNA test on Kipkemoi, whom they suspect was with Jepchumba when she died. A postmortem report showed Jepchumba was strangled, contrary to Kipkemoi’s claim that she fell into the falls while taking a selfie. Kipkemboi was arrested on July 12 at Kiamunyi after the results of the postmortem were released. The case will be mentioned today for bond terms. Justice Joel Ngugi ordered the Joseph Gitau to file an affidavit within a day. Lawyer David Mongeri said his client has been in custody for too long. Click here for the latest political news
