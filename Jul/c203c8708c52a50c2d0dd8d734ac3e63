A coffee outgrower programme will also be launched to support 3,300 smallholder farmers. The company plans to increase packaging capacity at its factory in Kenya. This will help it source an additional 5,000 tonnes of tea from farmers and local factories directly and via auction, IFC said. Global Tea and Commodities Ltd replaced Unilever to top Africa’s tea purchases at the Mombasa auction last year. It bought more than 16 per cent of the continent’s production. With sales in excess of $130 million (Sh13 billion), handling over 55 million kilos of tea annually, Global Tea currently employs more than 10,400 staff worldwide and is the United Kingdom’s largest independent tea company. It has tea trading offices in Kenya, Malawi, India and the UK that combine to provide total solutions to the tea trade through procurement, warehousing and blending services. It also has packing operations in major tea centres of the world. Global Teas and Commodities Ltd chief Fahim Ahmed said tea processing is currently being done in Kenya and the collaboration will increase packaging capacity. He said this will open doors for bigger projects in future and create jobs.
