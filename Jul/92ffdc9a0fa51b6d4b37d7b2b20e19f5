alphonce gari/ Kilifi governor Amason Kingi (pictured) wants the national government to make public the full report by the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission if it is committed to ending historical injustices. He said on Friday the injustices that led to the 2007 PEV have yet to be made public. “The TJRC report was clear on what caused the post-election violence. Former President Mwai Kibaki found it too hot and failed to make it public,’’ Kingi said.  He was speaking  in Gongoni, Magarini, during the handover of a registration certificate for a teachers’ training college — the county’s first. The county boss said the report has useful recommendations that would help to fix the ills committed in the past and prevent more injustices. Kingi said he will crack down on beach grabbing. The operation will cover Mtwapa and the county’s border with Tana River. He said they will protect public property and those who acquired parcels illegally will forfeit them.
