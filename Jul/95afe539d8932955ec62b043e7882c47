The Moi Teaching Referral Hospital is owed more than sh500 million in unpaid bills by patients. CEO Wison Aruasa says the hospital will for 30 days from Monday, July 9 give a 50 per cent waiver for individual patients who will pay their pending bills. He says the bills have accumulated for the last 18 years since the year 2000. “With the waiver, each individual patient will pay half of their bills”, said Dr Aruasa. Some of the patients left behind ID cards, land titles and other documents to be discharged and Dr Aruasa wants those with the pending bills to take advantage of the one-month waiver. In effect, the hospital will have waived Sh250 million from the total outstanding bills. At the same time the hospital has now increased its ICU beds capacity to 20 from 6 last year. Dr Aruasa says the new ICU units at the hospital include four put up by the Uasin Gishu County government. Dr Aruasa says the ICU units have latest state of the art machines to be able to handle patients effectively. “We are developing this hospital for the future so that it continues to offer the best services to patients”, said Dr Aruasa. The hospital last week commissioned a modern Kitchen for the facility. Governor Jackson Mandago presided over the event which was also attended by Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny. The team also inspected the new ICU units and the modern new Microwave incinerator put up at the hospital through support from the Belgium government at a cost of Sh100 million. The governor said the county would strictly monitor waste disposal by hospitals and other industries in the region. “We will not entertain stories again because we have to protect our environment and the lives of Kenyans”, said Mandago.
