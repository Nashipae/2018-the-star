Tuyisenge got a unanimous majority vote to beat team-mate Francis Kahata in the poll conducted by Sports Journalists Association of Kenya (SJAK) football committee. Tuyisenge has scored five goals in the month that K’Ogalo won all their five matches on a trot. The Rwanda international was awarded Sh100 000, a trophy and a 49-inch LG TV courtesy of sponsors at Camp Toyoyo on Thursday. Following another outstanding month that saw them pull clear of their closest challengers Sofapaka, the team got an extra Sh50,000 for their contribution to the player’s August exploits. En-route to winning the award, the 27-year-old scored a brace against Nzoia Sugar and a goal each against Wazito, Ulinzi Stars, Posta Rangers and Sony. “I’m so happy to have been recognised with this award. I have for a long time hoped to win it and it is great to finally get it. I dedicate it to my teammates who helped me achieve it. I can’t score without their input and they have really been great. Actually, Gor Mahia functions because we are a unit. We play as a team and that is why we are this strong,” the Rwandan forward said. Tuyisenge also hopes to track the absent Elvis Rupia’s goal count and clinch the ‘Golden Boot’ this year. He was a runner up for the gong last year and is the leading contender after Rupia’s departure to Zambia. “I can win the ‘Golden Boot this year. As a striker whenever I leave a football pitch without scoring, it hurts me so I want keep scoring and exceed the current leader who is not playing here anymore,” he added. Tuyisenge, who had a slow start to the season, was shouldered with the responsibility of taking over the scoring mantle from Meddie Kagere, who is now at Simba and did not disappoint. His five goals have clearly showed that he has what it takes to help the 16-time Kenya champions retain the Sportpesa Premier League crown. Gor Mahia are now 12 points clear on the log and are still active in the Caf Confederation Cup and the SportPesa FKF Shield tourney.
