Former Nyandarua Governor Daniel Waithaka was on Thursday arrested by
EACC amid the probe into a fraudulent Sh50million water and sewerage
tender. The former county chief was arrested alongside former
Water CEC Grace Gitonga and chief officer Kihiu Gichinga over the tender
awarded to Tahal Consulting Engineers. The three were nabbed
after presenting themselves to the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission
(EACC) detectives in Nyeri after they were summoned. Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji had ordered the governor and seven other suspects arrested and prosecuted. The DPP stated that EACC received reports December 4, 2014, and on May 15, 2016, that the officials flouted procurement rules. "The
EACC undertook investigations and established that the county
government of Nyandarua unlawfully engaged M/S Tahal Consulting
Engineers Ltd." "The firm was to undertake the development of a
county masterplan, design, and review of the sewerage system and
unlawfully paid a sum of S 50, 470, 513.90," Haji said in a press
statement. Waithaka was held at the EACC for hours for processing
and later taken to central police station. He will be taken to court on
Friday. Others implicated in the Sh50 million scandal include John Ngigi and Jesse Wachira, former officials of the county government. Read: DPP orders arrest of Nyandarua ex-Governor over illegal Sh50m tender Click here for the latest political news
