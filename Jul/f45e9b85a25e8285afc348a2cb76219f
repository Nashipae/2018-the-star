Nyandarua county commissioner Boaz Cherutich has warned students who go on strike they will be prosecuted. He urged schools’ management to work with parents and local leaders to address complaints by students and address indiscipline. Cherutich spoke as a new wave of school fires and riots rock the country. “The DCI has already issued instructions that any student who causes chaos be categorised as a criminal,” he said in Ol Kalou yesterday. He said parents and leaders should urge the students to be careful because violence and destruction of property will not be tolerated. Cherutich said most students strike only because they are not ready for exams.
