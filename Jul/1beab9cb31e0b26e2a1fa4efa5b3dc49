The National Parents Association has welcomed the proposal to abolish boarding schools to reduce or end cases of student unrest. The Education ministry submitted the proposal on Thursday to the National Assembly Education committee, noting that 142 students had been arrested for allegedly causing mayhem in schools. Association chair Nicholas Maiyo noted, however, that reducing the number of boarding schools will not solve the problem as the primary issue is the lack of values. In a phone interview on Saturday, he added: "The decision by the government may be chaotic if done quickly." Maiyo further said the government should set aside funds for the training of parents, and that they should be involved in the disciplining of learners.

The PS cited schools such as Strathmore High School and Kianda School, whose students are day scholars, contending that the same may be replicated in other schools across the country.
