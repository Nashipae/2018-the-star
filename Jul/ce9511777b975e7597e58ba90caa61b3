Journalist Dennis Omondi, who earlier flew to India for cancer treatment, died at KNH in Nairobi on Friday afternoon. The 31-year-old West Media photojournalist first visited doctors in December 2017 following spells of dizziness and weakness. He was initially treated for malaria but there was no improvement so he sought other opinions. Omondi visited Kenya Medical Association in January and saw Dr Walter Mwanda who decided to do a bone marrow test. A 20-minute test confirmed he had acute leukemia and led to his admission at Kenyatta National Hospital.
