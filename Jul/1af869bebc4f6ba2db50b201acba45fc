Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko (pictured) has bowed to pressure from MCAs and residents and scrapped the Sh30,000 fees required for squatters’ title deeds. He directed that all squatters who benefitted from the 50,000 deeds commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta on May 30 be issued for free. The governor commissioned the construction of roads in Eastlands yesterday. “All squatters who cannot pay ... should not be worried.” He said the gesture has not been extended to landlords who can raise the fee.
