Film director Scott Kennedy, an Oscar nominee, will be visiting East Africa this month for the screening of his film 'Food Evolution’. He will be hosted by the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa project. The movie, which premiered in US theatres, will be shown free to audiences in Africa, including universities, public schools and community groups. In Kenya, Scott Kennedy is scheduled to participate in a public screening at Kerugoya Kutus ACK Hall on July 12 and the University of Nairobi on July 13. Kennedy is renowned for his Oscar-nominated documentary The Garden, which tells the story of America’s struggle over the largest community garden in the country. He will meet farmers, students and policymakers to raise understanding and appreciation of agricultural biotechnology and its contribution to agricultural and societal development for informed decision-making.
