Traders in Nairobi, Thika and Rongai are still using plastic bags, despite a ban imposed on August 28 last year. Nema Nairobi county director Njoki Mukiri said neighbouring countries such as Somalia have not banned use plastic bags. This is rolling back the gains we have made, he said. “Corrupt individuals are sneaking them into the country,” Mukiri said. He said a crackdown on illegal distributors, manufacturers and sellers of plastic bags will go on. The government banned the use of plastic bags to conserve the environment and curb pollution. Many people found with the bags have been arrested and charged in court. Manufacturers have moved to court seeking to compel the government to give them Sh2 billion compensation for the losses they have incurred. A spot check by the Star showed traders in the mentioned towns are still using plastic bags for packaging. Moses Munoko, an advocate and an environmentalist, said if the ban is not enforced, the war on plastic bags may not be won. He urged the government to subsidise environmental-friendly carrier bags. Trader Jane Motare said corrupt individuals and law enforcers are behind the return of the bags. “When police arrest a person using plastic bags, they demand a bribe and the suspect is released to continue with the business,” she said. Motare said most businesses use the illegal bags from 6pm. “No one does inspection from 6pm since the official operation hours of public officers are between 8am and 5pm,” she said. Brian Njoroge, a resident in Thika, said the government should do more if it wants to conserve the environment. Another trader from Nairobi said they are driven by customers’ demands. “Some customers who buy vegetables are loyal. If someone sells to us plastic bags at a lower price, we play safe,” he said.
