Jubilee and NASA members have vowed to “fix” the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. The lawmakers have teamed to get their pound of flesh when vetting for the new commissioners begins next week. President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated former Kenya Power chief Ben Chumo as chairman to replace Sarah Serem, whose term ended. MPs were furious when Serem’s team slashed their princely salaries and allowances. Last week, the leaders gave a hint of picking “friendly” representatives at the helm of the agency. "The SRC is a matter we must deal with soberly. We had serious issues in the last five years. That was the only commission that was against the three arms of government," National Assembly Leader of Majority Aden Duale said, while supporting the extension of the vetting time for Chumo.  'Theatre table' Duale regretted that nominees representing the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) in the salaries agency did nothing to secure lawmakers’ interests. “We will put the nominees on a theatre table in the House, dissect them properly, diagnose and do referrals,” Duale said. The MPs accused the Serem team of unfairly scrapping their Sh5 million car grant, Sh5,000 per committee sitting and House plenary allowances. The commission also reduced their salaries from Sh710,000 to Sh621,250. The PSC, as one of the 13 nominating agencies, has one slot in the SRC, while the Senate is also required to nominate one person to represent the 47 counties. Minority Leader John Mbadi called for a thorough vetting. He said the next team of commissioners should be competent. Click here for the latest political news
