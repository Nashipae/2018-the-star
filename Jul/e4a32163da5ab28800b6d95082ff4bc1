The Sigiri Bridge in Budalang’i will be launched in the next few months, an engineer has said. The bridge is being built afresh by Chinese Overseas Construction Company after it collapsed last year. Engineer Lyn Miyoung yesterday said they are working round the clock to complete the bridge. Only five per cent of the work remains, he said. Miyoung said high levels in the River Nzoia slowed their work. “We’re putting the finishing touches before it’s officially handed over to the general public by the Head of State in the next few months,” Miyoung said. He said the firm will maintain the 100-metre bridge for five years after its commissioning.
