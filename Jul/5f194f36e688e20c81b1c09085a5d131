Garissa Senator Yussuf Haji has urged social media users to desist from maligning elected leaders. He said the platforms can easily mess the society if not used responsibly. Haji said people should verify information first. He spoke in Garissa town on Friday. Haji said it was wrong for critics to suggest that the county spent a lot money of money on a two-day conference organised by a task force on education. It has been alleged in social media that Sh8 million was used. Education stakeholders from across the county met at a Garissa hotel to find solutions to the falling education standards in the area. Some unhappy residents accused the executive of using the forum for personal gain. But Haji said the criticism was uncalled for. “I have no problem with social media, but my biggest worry is how it is being used. The habit of attacking people over unsubstantiated claims is unfair. This is an area of concern especially to the elderly people,” Haji said. “Don’t use social media to soil people’s names for the sake of it or because you have personal differences. Let’s respect elected leaders, even if we don’t support them.” Garissa Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane defended the county administration. He said the claims about the amount used to organise the forum were untrue. “I want to appeal to everyone to be careful on social media. People who jump to conclusions without facts should rethink their attitude,” Abdi said. Governor Ali Korane urged experts to propose solutions to declining education standards in the county. He spoke on Thursday when he opened the education conference in Garissa. A report by a county task force shows 92 per cent and 68 per cent of children eligible for secondary and primary education, respectively, are out of school.
