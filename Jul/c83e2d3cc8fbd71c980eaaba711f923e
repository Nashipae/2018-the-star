The hearing of the multi-billion Anglo leasing case was halted yesterday after defence lawyers protested the prosecution’s late delivery of documentary evidence. Defence lawyer Sadia Caren said she needed more time to adequately study the documents, which prosecution delayed in providing. Caren said she received documents two minutes before the start of the hearing. “The law requires that the defence be furnished with evidence to be relied upon by the prosecution and have time to engage that evidence but we got the documents late,” she said, at the Milimani Law Courts on Friday. Chief Magistrate Felix Kombo set the hearing of the case on diverse dates between October 11 and 15. For More Read:Lawyers poke holes in Anglo Leasing deal with Swiss company
