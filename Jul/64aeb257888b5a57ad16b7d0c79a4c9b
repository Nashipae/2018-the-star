Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba has recommended an audit of the incomplete Kitale Teaching and Referral Hospital. He made the proposal in a letter to the county assembly and the Senate. At least Sh1.4 billion has been spent on the project, which started in 2014. Speaking yesterday when he received two Cuban doctors, Khaemba said Trans Nzoia people do not appreciate good work. “Many times I have gone out of my way to offer the best services, but people are never appreciative, I’m tired of the accusations circulating around and unverified information that funds are being wasted,” he said. He called for 10 experts who will conduct a value-money audit at their own cost. Khaemba said the project has taken a long time because the assembly fails to approve necessary funds. “Every time I set a budget for a consultant it never gets approved. Every project needs a consultant,” the governor said. The county assembly has slashed the allocation for completion of the hospital from Sh330 million to Sh200 million. Speaker Joshua Werunga asked the Governor to have a roundtable discussion with all leaders in the region on the best way forward possible.
