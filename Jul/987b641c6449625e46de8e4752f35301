A Busia cleric has asked the national government not to handcuff leaders implicated in any wrongdoings, saying this is shaming them in public. Presiding bishop of Hope of God Gospel Mission Church in Busia Samuel Welimo on Sunday said it is inhuman and ungodly to treat a leader as if he is a notorious thug. He was responding to the manner in which Busia governor Sospeter Ojaamong was treated when he was arrested last week by the EACC over graft charges. “Any state leader or official who has been implicated in any crime should not be manhandled and handcuffed. It is a ridicule to his supporters and the electorate,” Welimo said. He said although he supports the war on corruption, leaders should not be humiliated and undermined when they surrender to state agencies or are arrested in a graft case. “Handcuffing a governor, a senator, an MP or any other state leader the way it was done to Ojaamong is wrong. After all he presented himself to the EACC,” the cleric said.
