Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto has said the Attorney General’s office is underfunded, resulting in acute shortage of staff. He said they requested Parliament to allocate the office Sh11.5 billion, but it got only Sh5.5 billion. “We will soon be engaging Parliament so we can get money for expansion,” Ogeto said. He spoke in Eldoret while visiting regional offices in 10 counties. Ogeto said the government would be forced to pay huge claims awarded by courts in cases where the state is not represented owing to a shortage of state counsels. “We will soon be engaging Parliament so that we can be allocated funds to carry out the expansion plans we have,” Ogeto said in Eldoret. He said the AG’s office plans to devolve its operations by opening offices in all the 47 counties in the next two years. Ogeto said the North Rift has three counsels.
