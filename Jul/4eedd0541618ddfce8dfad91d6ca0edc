Public Service Cabinet Secretary Margaret Kobia has said Huduma Centres will now operate from 6.30am to 7.30pm. They previous working hours were from 8am to 5pm. She launched the new working hours at the GPO Huduma Centre yesterday. Kobia said the shifts will enhance services and productivity. The first shift will run from 6.30am to 1.30pm and the second from 1.00pm to 7.30pm. The staff will work from Monday from Friday. “Huduma Kenya is doing this on a three months pilot basis at the GPO and City Square centres. There will be a 30 minute overlap to ensure there is proper handing over from the first shift to the second shift,” Kobia said.
