With favourites for the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) men’s Premier League title, Kenya Police and Butali Warriors, enjoying a rest this weekend, focus turns on the survival battle between the bottom two sides Western Jaguars and Badgers, who are seeking their second wins of the season as well as keeping their top flight status. After recording their maiden victory of the season a week ago, revitalised Jaguars who sit second from bottom with six points will scratch for maximum points in their weekend matches against 2012 champions Nairobi Sikh Union today and bottom placed Badgers tomorrow. However, Badgers head coach Cyrus Kanyi has disclosed that they have put behind their false start woes and are ready for the rest of the season. The former Kenyan International will return to the touch line after missing the previous clash against Kenya Police due to illness. As Badgers welcome their head coach, their opponents will have to do without theirs, Michael Malungu who is away with the national youth in Algeria. Today another relegation threatened side Nakuru Hockey Club host Parklands SC eyeing to delink themselves with the red line. The Anthony Agesa-coached side sit tenth on the log with eight points from nine matches. They hope to capitalize on the advantage against the visitors who are placed seventh with 12 points.

Mashujaa, under the tutelage of Tom Olal, are perched sixth with 13 points—one ahead of their opponents—who are ranked eighth.
