Five Wajir residents were injured on Thursday as police dispersed protesters who attempted to enter the county assembly to eject MCAs. The residents said they were tired of constant wars and drama in the House. Riot police restored order. Three MCAs  Shale Bule (Hadade), Abdi Aden (Wagala) and Osman Mukhtar of Arbajahan were arrested in connection with the violence. Numerous fistfights have broken out in the assembly. The MCAs disagree on virtually everything. The latest problem is the formation of the County Assembly Service Board. On Tuesday, speaker Ibrahim Yaqub told the House Issa Garore (Tarbaj) would represent the Majority party — Jubilee. He however rejected Minority’s Abdi Aden (NASA), saying he had “reservations about his nomination”. Some MCAs were against the decisions. Hussein Abdirahman accused Yaqub of imposing Garore on them. He said he was not Jubilee’s choice. The county leadership has remained mum as chaos rocks the assembly. Two groups have emerged — one loyal to the speaker and the executive and the other loyal to NASA. Majority leader Mohamud Gaben blamed the wrangles on “external forces” and said they would meet this weekend to fix the problem. “There’s a lot of political influence from outside, especially with the governor case still in court. But we’ll overcome it,” he said. Abdi Omar, chairperson of  the people living  with disability, said they have had enough and will no longer entertain MCAs’ tiffs. “Residents of Wajir face numerous challenges, which they need addressed. Instead, the MCAs are busy fighting and disagreeing on issues that are not of interest to us,” he said. Halima Barre said constant quarrels and standoffs hurt services.
