The President of the Swiss Confederation, Alain Berset will be on an official visit to Kenya from July 9th - 10th, 2018. State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said the visit is intended to strengthen ties to Kenya and identify other areas of cooperation, particularly on the Big 4 agenda. "Our partnership has since occasioned great progress in the health and development sectors and restored social security," he said in a statement on Wednesday. Esipisu said during his visit, Swiss Development Agency presence in ASAL areas will be highlighted. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation is currently supporting the strengthening of Kenya's water and livestock sectors in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands region. "Its projects are facilitating livestock production, increasing access to water and pasture and supporting counties to reduce conflicts and deliver the required services at the county level," Esipisu said. The government spokesman said Swiss Skills for Life pilot project in Kakuma Refugee Camp, IGAD-Switzerland cooperation and Swiss support to Kenya’s Big 4 Health Pillar. "Increased partnership in this area will, therefore, see more refugees integrated into the host communities and lift some of the barriers to inclusion that continue to affect the refugees from our neighbouring countries,"  Esipisu said.
