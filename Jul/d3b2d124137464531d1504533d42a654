The Kenya
Gazette is the official government mouthpiece for notifying the public
of any action, appointment or legislation. It is registered at the
General Publications
Office as the official government newspaper for publishing notices of
new
bills, all notices required by law and other  announcements from the
three arms of government — Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. Ordinary citizens also post notices of public interest such
as succession and undertakings requiring public participation such as environmental
impact assessment. The century-old relic of the colonial administration has sometimes
been abused to cover up mischievous state actions. This became apparent during
the presidential petition when IEBC disclosed that it had published notices nobody knew about. The gazette, which retails for Sh60 from the Government
Printer, circulates mainly to state departments and subscribing lawyers. It
is often out of stock even at the printer. Editions listed as published are hard
to find at the printer, raising the question: for whom is it published? With
digitisation of government functions, the scanned gazette is now
available online
at Kenyalaw.org. However, government now has a weekly publication, My
Gov, inserted in daily newspapers — reporting government activities and
publishing important information
such as tenders. Shouldn't the Gazette, too, be published as an insert
or
replaced altogether?
