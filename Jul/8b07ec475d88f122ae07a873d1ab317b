MUTUA KAMETI/ Police in Makueni have arrested two suspects and impounded bhang worth Sh5 million. Makueni county commissioner Mohammed Maalim said a third suspect is on the run. The bhang is suspected to have been trafficked from Tanzania. Maalim said the bhang was stocked in two vehicles destined for Mombasa. Police patrolling the Nairobi-Mombasa highway chased one of the vehicles, forcing the driver to abandon it at Ndiini in Taita Taveta county. The officers had been alerted that vehicles suspected to be transporting bang had passed Migori and were heading to Mombasa. “Our officers set a trap but the driver of the first vehicle defied orders to stop, instead he sped off, forcing the officers to give chase but he abandoned the vehicle in Taita Taveta,” Maalim told reporters at Sultan Hamud police station. The driver of the second vehicle diverted to Wote upon reaching Makindu after he realised police were pursuing him.  He was arrested at Kathonzweni with an accomplice. Yesterday, Maalim said the police had separately recovered more than 100 cartons with 2,000 bottles of 250ml counterfeit Vodka with a street value of more than Sh 220,000.  The counterfeit Vodka was recovered in Emali. “We also impounded a lorry with 200 bags of sugar and 300 bags of rice and made two arrests,” said Maalim. The county commissioner said he called the inter-agency team from Nairobi to travel to Wote in Makueni to verify the cargo. “We have embarked on a massive operation across the county to rid it of contraband and counterfeit products,” he said. “We cannot allow people to make quick money by doing illegal business,” he said.
