Rapper-turned-politician Jaguar was discharged from hospital yesterday after being treated for a dislocated ankle. The Starehe MP, whose government name is Charles Njagua, dislocated his right ankle during a scuffle between traders at Marikiti market and city council askaris on Wednesday evening. The county operators had been looking for hawkers who went to hide in the market. Their arrest of an innocent man led to a deadly confrontation. Jaguar told Word Is, "I tried to convince the City Council askaris that the young man called Bob that they had arrested was not a hawker but they would not listen to me. This led to a back-and-forth between them and the traders at Marigiti market. Before I knew it an ugly scuffle ensued and chaos took over." The singer, who recently released a single called Timika with his hitherto enemy rapper Prezzo, added that "as an MP of the area, I cannot not fight for my people. I'm calling on the county government and the governor to keep his campaign promise of taking the City Council askaris for retraining, so they can learn how to handle wananchi and not just go around beating up guys and arresting them arbitrarily." Jaguar says he dislocated his ankle when he was jumping over a wall to get away from the rungu-wielding city council askaris, who were chasing away the protesting Marigiti market traders.
