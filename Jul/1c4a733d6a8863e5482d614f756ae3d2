A dormitory at St. Stephens Menara Boys in Muhoroni sub-county, Kisumu has been razed down. The dorm -Hellen Bolo- was housing both form one and two students. Area OCPD Mohammed Jarso said the fire started around 5.20 pm. He said one of the teachers noticed smoke coming out of the dorm and raised an alarm but attempts to salvage students property were futile as it had already spread. "One dorm was totally burnt down during the fire incident but we thank God there were no casualties," added the OCPD. He told the Star that the cause of the fire is yet to be known. Hours later another fire was reported at a neighbouring school, St Augustine Kandege. Mohammed said they managed to put off the fire before spreading and only four beds were burnt. "We have already launched investigations into this two incidences to find out the cause, "he added.
