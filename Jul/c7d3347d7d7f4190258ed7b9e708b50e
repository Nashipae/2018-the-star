Speaker Beatrice Elachi has said that county assemblies will petition the Senate to repeal the law to recognise the position of deputy speaker. This follows a court ruling in Murang’a two weeks ago that declared the seat illegal. The Court ruled that the position is not defined in the County Government’s Act thus declaring it null and void. But Elachi said that all deputy speaker positions in the 47 county assemblies risk being declared illegal unless the law is amended. She said that she would ask the County Assemblies Forum, the body that brings together all the 47 county assemblies, to petition the Senate to amend the Act. “As CAF, we are going to petition the leader of the majority in the Senate honourable Kipchumba Murkomen to see how this law can be amended so that we don’t risk,” Elachi said. Elachi said that county assemblies are a replica of the National Assembly and the Senate and therefore the position of the deputy speaker should be anchored in law. The Act does not clearly define the position. Instead, it provides for the creation of the speaker’s panel, whose member can stand in as speaker in case the speaker is away. “The speaker should have a deputy to help him or her. Sometimes both of them can be away and that is why the speaker’s panel was created so that a member of that committee can sit as the chairman,” she said.
