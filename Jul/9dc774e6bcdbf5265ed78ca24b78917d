STARRING: Alicia Silverstone, Mena Suvari, Jennifer Bartels, Makenna James, Lia McHugh GENRE: Comedy RELEASE DATE: June 7  Fans of reality show Real Housewives of Beverly Hills are familiar with the story of American Woman, as it is based on reality star Kim Richards’ childhood. The creation of a series was the subject of many discussions and arguments between Housewives star Kyle and her sister Kim Richards and Kathy Hilton. Fans have been anxious to find out what ‘dirty family secrets’ the sisters didn’t want to share. American Woman recounts the story of Bonnie Noland, a well-kept California housewife with two daughters. When Bonnie finds out her husband Steve is cheating on her, she decides to leave him. Which is easier said than done because Bonnie has never had a job nor been able to support herself financially. She ends up getting a job in retail as she strives to provide for her family. Bonnie finds solace in her two friends Diana and Kathleen, both of whom are struggling to find their own independence. But in the 1970s, the idea of an independent woman was hardly conceivable. The show follows the three women as they navigate the muddy waters of the male-dominated era by riding the wave of the rising feminism movement. The show is an easy 20-minute watch. It avoids all the complications that came with the 70s, such as sex, drugs and hard-core feminism. It’s an age-old story of a woman who’s been shielded from most things in life and how she ends up having to overcome all the odds to survive. There’s not much in the story that reveals personal information about the Richards’ sisters. All in all, the show is a light fix at the end of a long day. The show also sees the return of Alicia Silverstone (Clueless) on the small screen.  Star Rating: 3/5
