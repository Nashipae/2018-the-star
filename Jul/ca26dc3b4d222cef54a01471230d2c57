The Court of Appeal has upheld the election of Migori Governor Obado Okoth. Appellate judges sitting in Kisumu dismissed the petition against Obado, saying the petitioner Ochilo Ayacko failed to discharge the burden of proof. Judge Stephen Gatembu, who read the verdict on behalf of the three-judge bench, said the court is satisfied with High Court's decision that the election was fair. The judges ruled that there was no sufficient evidence on irregularities and bribery allegations as claimed by Ayacko. The judge ordered the former Cabinet minister to pay Sh 4.5 million as suit cost. During the hearing, five petitioner witnesses who took the stand testified that Obado and his handlers bribed voters ahead of the August 8, 2017, General Election. Among them were Lucas Opere, a boda-boda rider from Awendo, Tom Omollo, a driver at the Sony Sugar Company, and Oliver Jabuya. Opere said at a meeting in March with other boda boda riders at Sony Sugar Stadium, the governor gave them Sh1,000 and asked them to vote for him for his second term. Meanwhile, the election of Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tongi has been upheld by the Court of Appeal. The appeal was dismissed as it lacked merit. Making the ruling, Justice Kathurima Minoti said the appeal lack merit and it would be unfair to subject the people Nyaribari Chacge to repeat election. He directed the appellant Zaheer Jhanda to pay Sh2million as cost. Zaheer challenged the election of Tongi at the High Court citing irregularities, voter bribery and violence. The petition was quashed by the High Court over insufficient evidence. Read: Witnesses cite voter bribery in Obado petition Click here for the latest political news
