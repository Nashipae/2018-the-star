Four schools have been banned from participating in the term two games for fielding ineligible players. They are Kapenguria Boys, Tetu Boys, and two others. The third school was runners-up at the regional level. Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) secretary David Ngugi did not give the name of the third school. The fourth school - which was also not named in the KSSSA statement to the press on Wednesday, was disqualified in Nyanza. Ngugi said the schools fielded players who were either non-students or were above 19 years - the maximum age allowed for participants. Nyanza regional education coordinator Richard Chepkawai said they ensured that a school which had violated the rules did not get a slot at the national levels. Fielding over-age players in the schools’ competition go against the rules and regulations of the association. The offence is mostly punishable by bans and suspension of officials involved. This year’s Term Two secondary schools tournament kicked off on Tuesday at the Hill’s School in Eldoret. Rift Valley education coordinator Mary Gaturu condemned the fielding of ineligible players saying it defeats efforts to help students develop their talents. "Just as the ministry was fighting examination cheating, it will fight cheating in sports," she said. Click here for the latest political news
