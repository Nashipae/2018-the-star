A matatu tout fell following a scuffle with a traffic policeman and was run over and killed by the matatu in which his brother was the driver. Walter Nyang’au, 24, of Embassava Sacco was run over after he was allegedly yanked off the moving mini bus by a policeman. He fell head first and the rear wheels run over him. Nyang’au later died at the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital where he had been rushed by his brother Edwin Osongo. Osongo was the driver of the bus and had no idea of the unfolding tragedy and the argument between his brother and the policeman. The policeman disappeared from the scene immediately after the incident as irate mob bayed for his blood. But police gave a different account of the incident. Police records at Buruburu police station described Nyang’au as a passenger. It said a passenger alighted from the vehicle after seeing a police officer who was on patrol standing at the service lane and in the process, he slipped and fell down and was ran over by the front left tire and sustained serious head  and neck injuries. The report says the incident happened at 7.30 am but was recorded at 11am. Embassava Sacco chairman John Ongaro said they had not received much information about the incident.
