Disciplinary action has been taken against the employee who drafted the Chandarana Foodplus racist promotion, the supermarket's management said on Monday. Rima Patel, a marketing specialist at the store, is accused of authoring an email which said that the supermarket now focuses on white people'. "We would like to give you free vouchers to winner/raffles/best
performer/runners-up candidate in upcoming events." "As we are now focusing on white people to 'attract our supermarkets' sic," read the controversialÂ email.

profiled some of its customers. "We have also commenced
disciplinary action on the employee who authored the promotion
communication," director Dipam Thakkar said. Thakkar also pleaded with the government to spare the business saying
it benefits over one million people in both direct and indirect
employment. He said that the supermarket has employed about 1,246 people in various capacities, including management. "You
will be happy to know that out of this number, only 3 per cent are
expatriates. We endeavour to employ more of our Kenyan brothers." "Generally, our business touches the lives of close to one million people," Thakkar
said. He added that 95 per cent of their merchandise are sourced from local companies and individuals. The chain store has over 2,500 suppliers. Thakkar reiterated the supermarket's apology of the message which sparked a public outcry with city residents calling for the boycott of Chandarana. Sonko had issued a directive for the business' licence to be revoked, the same was not effected as at Monday as business at the supermarket's various outlet went on.
