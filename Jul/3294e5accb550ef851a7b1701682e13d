Fourteen counties forming the Lake Region Economic Bloc plan to establish a major agricultural research centre to offer new farming technology services.
The research facility is aimed at guiding counties on best fish production, how to access seeds, fertilisers, animal feeds, veterinary services, irrigation and best farming practices.
Counties forming the LREB are Trans Nzoia, Kericho, Bomet, Nandi, Kisii, Nyamira, Homa Bay, Migori, Kisumu, Siaya, Busia, Kakamega, Bungoma and Migori.
Bloc chairman and Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya said the facility will help counties achieve food sustainability as envisaged in the Big Four agenda.
His speech was read by Siaya governor Cornel Rasanga at the ASK Kisumu Show on Saturday.
Oparanya said the Lake region has significant agricultural potential because it has large amounts of fertile land and good rainfall.
The main crops in the region are rice, maize, sorghum, beans, sugarcane and tea.
The chairman said farmers’ problems include  over-reliance on rainfed agriculture, lack of agro-based micro industries for value addition, low purchasing power, poor agricultural technologies and environmental degradation.
“The main impediments to optimum agricultural productivity in the region include subsistence farming rooted in a low level of technical know-how among farmers and the lack of irrigation and modern farming methods,” he said.
Oparanya said through the bloc, member counties can promote innovation and technologies in agriculture and trade to uplift living standards.
“It is only through a well-structured economic framework like LREB that our agriculture, tourism, trade and environment can be assured of sustainable growth,” he said.
