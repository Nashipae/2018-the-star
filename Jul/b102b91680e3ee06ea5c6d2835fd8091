Jacque Maribe got engaged over the weekend. The Citizen TV news anchor was surprised by her fiance, Joe Jowie. Kidum serenaded the surprised bride-to-be with his hit song, Mapenzi, as the plan was in motion. Later, Jowie popped out the ring. Jacque said yes. After the pictures were posted on social media by her friends, everyone in the comment section kept asking about Dennis Itumbi. Dennis swallowed his pride and congratulated the couple. "May laughter fill your path. May you live to enjoy life and share the beauty of your love with Jowi. Congratulations buddy." They then joked about the rumours linking them together, terming them imaginary facts.
