Two secondary schools have been closed and 2,000 students sent home after dormitories in Nandi county were razed. St Joseph’s Chepterit and Kipsigak high schools were closed following fires that destroyed three dormitories. More than 1,400 students from St Joseph’s Chepterit were asked to leave the school compound after a second dormitory was set ablaze on Friday night, three days after the first one was reported. The institution is the only girls’ national school in Nandi, while Kipsigak is an extra-county institution. Nandi Central OCPD Stephen Obara said police suspect some students of Kipsigak set their dormitory on fire in protest. “Kipsigak dormitory was set on fire on Sunday morning by boys. We are currently interrogating some of them at the school before we send them away,” he said. There was unrest after students allegedly demanded they get access to the KCSE exam beforehand. However, at St Joseph’s Chepterit, which has had two cases of arson, students were ordered to leave the school after the second dormitory was burnt. In both incidences, dormitories were set on fire when all students were attending night preps. St Joseph’s is sponsored by the Catholic church. No student was injured in both incidents. St Joseph’s principal Priscilla Kamau swapped positions with Consolata Tum who went Tartar girls in West Pokot. The schools had just started their Form 4 mock examinations while other classes were set to start their end-term exam yesterday. Both were long-serving heads in their former schools and were moved in the TSC delocalisation programme. Kamau said the fire broke out at night and that the students were sent home for a month. DCI officers pitched tent at the institution for the better part of the weekend and believe the fire was an inside job. Click here for the latest political news
