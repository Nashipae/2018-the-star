A suspected gang leader, whose photographs police circulated widely from June 14, was arrested in Uasin Gishu on Thursday. Officers found suspect William Kiplagat at what they said was his hideout at Mugundoi in Kesses constituency. “We got credible information that he was in the area so we acted immediately," county AP Commandant Daniel Rukunga said. "He was immediately handed over to police in Bungoma where he is wanted for a series of serious crimes”." Rukunga asked residents to help identify all criminals in the region so security is improved. Police in the area have arrested at least 10 wanted criminals in the last two months following complaints of attacks since last year. Uasin Gishu County Commissioner Abdi Hassan said they were hunting gangsters who operate in residential areas including Mwanzo estate. "The suspects we have arrested will face the law. We have issued a
warning for those still out there to surrender as we will deal with them ruthlessly," he said. Hassan noted that drug and alcohol abuse contribute to the rise in crime, especially in slums. “We will crack down on those selling and consuming
illicit drugs and alcohol," he told reporters in Eldoret. Read: Gang kills Bungoma businessman, injures son and boda boda rider Also read: Police hunt gangs in Eldoret after hawkers and county askaris clash Click here for the latest political news
