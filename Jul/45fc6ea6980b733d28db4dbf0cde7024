Garissa Governor Ali Korane has urged residents to support his development agenda regardless of their political affiliation. He said unity will help the county to achieve its goals. Last year’s gruelling and divisive campaigns characterised by name-calling are over, he said in Masalani town, Ijara constituency. Korane and former county boss Nathif Jama have buried the hatchet “for the common good of our people”. "I want to remind the people of Garissa that elections are behind us. It’s time to work. Everybody, including elected and appointed leaders, have a role to play in transforming Garissa," Korane said. He plans to tour Garissa’s seven subcounties in the next one month to initiate projects and listen to residents’ grievances. "I want to hear from the residents themselves and understand their concerns and issues they want prioritised." Korane said, adding he is keen to deliver on his pledges and other leaders should support him. Ijara MP Sophia Abdinoor urged the county administration to initiate an affirmative action plan on health and education in her constituency. She said several hospitals lack medicines and some have acute staff shortages, taking a heavy toll on patients and learners. "We have facilities in Holugho, Sangailu, Ijara and Kotile, which have either been shut, or are on the verge of being shut,” Abdinoor said. "Devolution was meant to bring services closer to the people, especially the rural folk. It isn’t right that the same people still suffer even with devolution in place." Last month, the MP said she will fully sponsor students pursuing teaching and nursing courses to fix staff shortages in the sectors. Several non-native teachers and health workers fled following terror attacks that targetted them.
