League leaders Thika Queens have a chance to extend their lead and unbeaten run when they host Kayole Starlet and Mombasa Olympic as the second leg of the Football Kenya Federation, Premier League gets underway across the nation this weekend. Thika lead the standings with 36 points from 12 matches and come up against 13th-placed Kayole with 11 points today before welcoming Olympic tomorrow. Olympic and Baringo Starlets remain candidates for relegation but Olympic coach Joseph Oyoo believes the second leg will give them a chance to make amends. He said: “We lie second from bottom and it is not a place we would have loved to be, but I believe we will come around in the second leg and hopefully evade the drop.” But a slip up by Thika will give a chance to champions Vihiga Queens, who have a date with bottom-placed and win-less Baringo Starlets tomorrow at Eldama Ravine grounds. Vihiga are second with 33 points from 13 matches. Oserian play host to Mombasa Olympics as Wadadia face off with Spedag at the Mumias Complex. On form Trans Nzoia Falcons play Gaspo at the Ruiru grounds while Soccer Queens will wrap up today’s fixtures with a tie against Vihiga Leeds.
