Kenya Rugby Union Championship side Kisumu RFC has roped in former Kenya Sevens coach Benjamin Ayimba as a technical advisor ahead of the forthcoming national Sevens circuit. Team manager, Shellan Nyawira, also confirmed the recruitment of former Impala and Kabras team manager Phillip Mwenesi as their coach and will be assisted by Dick Osano. Anthony Muchiri has also joined the Kisumu technical bench from Kabras. “This technical bench will only handle the Sevens series. We have not decided on the 15’s KRU Championship league but a decision will be made later. However, we want a very strong technical bench,” said Nyawira. “If things go well, Ayimba will join us for the 15’s league as we push to return to Kenya Cup.” Ayimba participated in the recruitment of 25 new players for Kisumu two weeks ago. Nyawira confirmed that the Silverstone Air-sponsored team will participate in the entire Sevens series. “We are hoping to be invited for Prinsloo 7’s first division. If we are invited, we shall remain in the first division in the entire series,” Nyawira noted. In the recent Citam 7’s, Kisumu fielded their development side which finished third after edging relegated Championship outfit Moi University 17-5. In the semis, Kisumu lost 31-5 to fellow Championship side, Kisii.
