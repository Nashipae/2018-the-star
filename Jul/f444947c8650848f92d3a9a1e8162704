Treasury’s move to slash the Equalisation Fund by Sh14 billion is illegal, Northern governors have said. Ten governors under the Frontier Counties Development Council (FCDC), yesterday said they will challenge the move in court. FCDC chairman Ali Roba said reducing the fund was against the Constitution. He accused Treasury CS Henry Rotich of abuse of office. Spaking at the Great Rift Valley Lodge in Naivasha, Roba said some counties like Nairobi which is not a marginalised region have been included as beneficiaries of the kitty. “We shall not sit back as watch our rights trampled on,” Roba said. The Mandera governor said Rotich ignored the formula for the allocation of the funds and also failed to involve governors. “The formula of disbursing these funds is supposed to be reviewed after 20 years. Rotich's move is an abuse of office,” he said. Marsabit's Mohamud Ali said inclusion of more counties into the kitty will erode its intention to spur growth in marginalised regions.
