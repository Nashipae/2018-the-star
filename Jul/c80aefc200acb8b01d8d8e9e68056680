The Kenya National Union of Teachers is threatening to go on strike because it does not like the Education ministry policy of sending head teachers away from their home areas (see P2). This does not merit strike action. Knut should go and talk to the ministry to resolve their differences. In any case it would be even worse to only send head teachers to schools in their home areas as Knut seems to want. The heads might neglect their duties by getting into business or farming if their homes and property are nearby. Non-local heads would probably work harder. Local heads would also come under greater pressure from local people, perhaps their relatives or friends, to favour pupils with better marks or exam assistance. And finally it would balkanise Kenya to have only local teachers instructing local pupils. Kenya has too many problems already with ethnic fragmentation. This would make it worse. The Education ministry should not retreat on having non-local head teachers, and Knut should drop its strike threat.  Quote of the day: "You don't learn to walk by following rules.
