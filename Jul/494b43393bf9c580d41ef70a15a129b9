Harambee Starlets face Ethiopia today as they seek to record their first win in the Cecafa women’s tournament at the Stade Régional de Nyamirambo in Kigali, Rwanda. Rwanda hosts leaders Uganda in the second match of the day. The side, coached by David Ouma, lost their opening match against Uganda 1-0 last Thursday before they came from behind to hold Tanzania 1-1 on Saturday. The on form Mwanahalima Adam scored late in the match to save the 2016 runners up blushes after Daniel Donisia’s 13th minute goal had put the champions in the lead. A win for Kenya against Ethiopia will see Starlets move joint second with Tanzania who have four points from three matches. Kenya currently lie bottom of the log prior to today’s clash with a point from two matches. However, failure for Starlets to go past last year’s bronze medallist, will technically lock them out of the race with a match in hand against hosts Rwanda on Friday. In the 2016 edition, Kenya laboured to see off Ethiopia in the semi-final and their opponents who sit third on the log with three points, will be out for a revenge. Ethiopia will be seeking to record their second win having beaten Rwanda and lost against Uganda. Coach Ouma has been toying with the line-up and it remains to be seen who will make the starting line-up. In the match against Tanzania, Teresia Engesha who had featured against Uganda and failed to sparkle was not fielded. Esse Akida started in her place having come in as a substitute in the first match against Uganda. In the defending department, Wendy Achieng who has formed a formidable partnership with Lilian Adera, Dorcas Shikobe and Elizabeth Ambogo was overlooked in the match against Tanzania with Vivian Nasaka starting.
