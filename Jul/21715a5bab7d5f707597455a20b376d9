The trial of Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter and two others with forging Treasury bills valued at Sh633 million will begin on October 2. Keter is charged alongside two co-directors of Desai Industries - Madat Chatur and Arthur Sakwa. Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi set the hearing for October 2 and 3 after defence lawyers confirmed receiving documentary evidence to be relied on during the trial. State counsel Solomon Naulikha said on Wednesday that the prosecution had lined up 13 witnesses and 16 exhibits. The suspects were in court during the pre-trial agreement. They were dramatically arrested by officers from the DCI's Banking Fraud Investigation Unit at Central Bank of Kenya offices on February 16. The three were nabbed after allegedly presenting a set of forged Treasury bills which were purportedly issued by the CBK a number of years ago.
