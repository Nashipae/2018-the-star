Former Nyandarua Governor Daniel Waithaka and two others on Friday appeared before a Nyahururu court over Sh50 million corruption allegations. Waithaka was arraigned alongside former Water executive, Grace Gitonga and water engineer Gaiko Kihiu Gichinga. They did not take plea before Nyahururu resident magistrate James Wanyanga. Wanyanga said he did not have the jurisdiction to hear corruption cases and referred them to Nakuru high court. The three are to face charges associated with corruption leading to the loss of Sh 50 million to an Israel company, Tahal limited. Among the charges were the failure to comply with procurement laws, engaging in projects without prior planning, failure to comply with the law relating to procurement laws, abuse of office and imprudent acquisition of public property. They were arrested on Thursday after they presented themselves at Nyeri Ethics and Anti-Corruption offices. On Wednesday evening the Director of Prosecutions Noordin Haji ordered the Governor be prosecuted for faulting procurement laws. The county government had in 2014 signed the deal with an Israel company, Tahal Limited to do a water master plan and sewerage system for Ol Kalou town which is the headquarters of the county. The county paid Sh 50 million to the company. The ODPP noted that Tahal was engaged on February 2, 2016 yet the contract was entered into two years earlier, on April 30, 2014.
