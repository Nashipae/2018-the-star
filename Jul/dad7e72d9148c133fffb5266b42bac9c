The National Assembly Environment and Natural Resources committee wants riparian land protected and encroachers ordered to vacate. The House team, led by chairperson Kareke Mbiuki, yesterday said rivers must be conserved. Mbiuki urged the National Environment Management Authority and the Water Resources Management Authority to up their game and deliver on their mandate to ensure no one violates the law by grabbing public property. He said rivers such as Nairobi, Sabaki and Athi are in ruins and called for swift action to stop further degradation. “We will find time to come and give direction on issues of encroachment on Sabaki River. We’ve extended our site visits to Nairobi, Mombasa and Machakos counties,” Mbiuki said. The committee toured Sabaki in Mavoko, Machakos. Two investors, Canon Aluminum and Rogam Invested Company Limited, had disagreed on their land boundaries — where the river passes. Both investors had encroached on the riparian land, prompting the river to change its course. “In the process of conducting inspections on the affected areas, Rogam on July 3, 2018, requested the committee to visit this area on a fact-finding mission and mediate to find an amicable solution,” Mbiuki said. He said the conflict between the investors was not a disagreement but a misunderstanding because none had filed a case in court. “Rogam’s concern was encroachment on riparian land by Canon Aluminum,” Mbiuki said. He said Warma had resolved the matter in 2016 and directed that the property erected on riparian land be demolished. This had not been implemented. The committee will ensure Warma’s resolutions are “implemented to the letter”. It issued the investors two months, effective from yesterday, to demolish all their structures on River Sabaki’s riparian. Mbiuki said the firms, Nema, Warma and the regional administration, led by Athi River deputy county commissioner David Juma, should be involved settling the dispute so the river is saved.
