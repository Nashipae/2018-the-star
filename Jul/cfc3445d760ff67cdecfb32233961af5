Kenyans will enjoy cheaper electricity starting next month thanks to a tariff review that has cut costs by up to 82 percent. while unveiling the new power tariff in Nairobi on Monday, Energy Regulatory Commission Director General Pavel Oimeke said the government has scrapped a monthly fixed charge of Sh150 for low cost consumers whose number is an estimated 3.6 million. ''The domestic consumer lifeline tariff, which is meant to cushion low income households whose consumption does not exceed 10 units per billing period, will reduce by between 36 to 82 percent,' Oimeke said. Commercial and industrial customers will get a reduction of 4.4 percent on average. This is in addition to the 50 percent discount in the time of use tariffs. With the new tariff, the overall cost of power reduces from Sh17.87/KWh to Sh16.64. Related: Energy cost to reduce by 8 per cent from July Click here for the latest political news
