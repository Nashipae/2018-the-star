KCPE and KCSE candidates whose studies have been disrupted by the demolition of eight schools in Kibra, Nairobi, will be transferred to other centres, Education CS Amina Mohamed has said. About 2,100 students have been affected in the demolition targeting structures built on road and rail reserve along the Ngong-Langata link road. Speaking in Nairobi yesterday, Amina said the students will be transferred to nearby schools to continue with their studies. “All the learners will be absorbed in the nearest public schools. National examination candidates will be immediately transferred to alternative centres,” Amina said. Among the schools demolished are Mashimoni, Adventure Pride Centre, Love Africa Somi, Egesa, Makina Self, Makina Baptist, Patmos and Saviour King. It has emerged that three of the schools had not been registered under the ministry as required. Amina warned that they risked being shut down. “Those operating without registration should take this opportunity and register because the ministry will soon conduct a crackdown to close them,” the CS said. The demolition that began on Monday have split opinion with human rights agencies asking President Uhuru Kenyatta to have it halted. Eight human rights groups on Wednesday said the demolition and eviction did not comply with the law and international conventions. The groups include Amnesty International, Cradle Kenya, Pamoja Trust, Shining Hope for Communities and International Commission of Jurists.
