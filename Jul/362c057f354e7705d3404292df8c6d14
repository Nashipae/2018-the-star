More than 200 youth from Kinangop have been trained on disaster management. The two-day training was facilitated by the National Disaster Management Unit. This followed a request to the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet by the Kenya Scouts Association after the FlySax Aircraft accident in the Aberdares forest on June 5. Kinangop scout commander Patience Manga said the hundreds of youths who assisted the security agents search for the aircraft had said they needed training to deal with such disasters in future. The team was trained on fire, road and air accidents, flooding and disaster prevention among others. “We are now equipped with the necessary skills to deal with any kind of disaster. We are now ready to go and assist anywhere in the country where the need calls,” Manga said. said the trainees who constituted primary school pupils, secondary,university and college students now qualify to serve in various capacities in disaster management.
