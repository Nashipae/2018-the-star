Meru University students will on Thursday hold a peaceful procession to the High Court, where a police officer accused if killing their leader is expected to take plea. Students organisation chairman Wangila Wabomba yesterday told the Star they will march from the institution’s campus to Meru town, demanding justice for the brutal murder of secretary general Evans Njoroge. Njoroge was killed on February 27 when he led students in protests over fee increments among other grievances. “All comrades will be heading to the court. The procession starts at 7am. Kenyans of good will are urged to join us,” Wabomba said.
