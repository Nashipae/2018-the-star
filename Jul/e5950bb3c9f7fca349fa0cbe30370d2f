A Limuru court yesterday ordered 11 students from Ngarariga Girls High School locked up at Lang’ata Women’s Prison in Nairobi. They were charged with attempting to commit a felony at the school. The Form 4 students denied the charge before senior principal magistrate Everlyne Olwade. Their parents were given the option of paying Sh50,000 cash bail instead.. The parents broke into loud cries, urging the magistrate to reduce the bail terms. Olwade ordered the parents to be quiet and give their children’s lawyer time to address the court. “Observe silence in court. Let the court carry on its business. Do not interrupt the proceedings. You can go outside and talk. You have a lawyer who is addressing the court on your behalf,” the magistrate said. After the magistrate’s ruling, the parents, who were still whispering, were pushed outside by court orderlies. Proceedings were briefly disrupted. The students’ lawyer told the magistrate the girls had suffered in police custody for fie days. He asked the court to provide him with witness statements and any other exhibit the prosecution wished to use in the trial. Through their lawyer, the students asked for lenient bail but the magistrate said Sh50,000 was fair. The court was told the students were found preparing to commit an offence on the night of July 19 at their school in Limuru constituency.
