The opposition is re-branding after the peace pact between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has said. He said the opposition has not been playing its role effectively since the March 9 handshake between the leaders. Mudavadi said some leaders were reluctant to take on the government. However, he told Kenyans expect a rejuvenated opposition. The ANC leader spoke at the Redeemed Gospel Church in Kisumu on Sunday. He was accompanied by Butere MP Tindi Mwale.
