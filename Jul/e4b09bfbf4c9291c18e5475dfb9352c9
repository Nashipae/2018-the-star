Lack of public participation is hampering Parliamentâ€™s ability to enact laws. The 12th Parliament has been spending large sums in placing adverts in the media, inviting members of public to give their input on legislation in the National Assembly and the Senate. Yesterday, Kenyans failed to present their momoranda before the Senate Justice, Legal and Human Rights committee on the Impeachment Procedure Bill, 2018. The bill sponsored by Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei seeks to provide a framework for the impeachment of a President, Deputy President , Cabinet Secretaries, governors, deputy governors and county executives. Cherargei ,who is also the chairmain of the committee, said they expected to receive views from all stakeholders. They include the Council of Governors, the Attorney General, the Kenya Law Reforms, the Law Society of Kenya and private citizens. They extended the timeline to July 31 to meet the constitutional requirement.
