A police officer accused of killing university student Evans Njoroge alias Kidero has denied the charge. Administration Police officer Leakey Maona on Thursday pleaded not guilty before Meru High Court judge Francis Gikonyo. The Meru University student leader was shot dead on February 27 during protests over fee increment. The prosecution wanted the case to proceed to hearing but the defence said the suspect had spent two weeks in police cells at Meru Prison. A bail application was also opposed by the prosecution.
