Police in Naivasha are probing the death of a Swedish national whose body was found in a house he had been living in with a Kenyan woman. The body of 82-year-old Sven Ollrect was found on Tuesday after the woman alerted the police over his death at their house in Kabati. There are reports the foreign national had been sick for some time and was living under inhumane conditions with the middle-aged woman. Paul Kariuki, a resident, said: "He would walk to a shop and greet people on the streets before going back to the house and we knew him as a friendly person to all." Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said they are investigating the circumstances under which the foreigner came to the country. He said there were no documents in the house to show the man's citizenship status adding that they are working with the Swedish embassy on the same. Elsewhere, a 66-year-old man committed suicide in her house at Haraka village, Kinangop. Residents said this was not the first case of an elderly person committing suicide in the area. The man left a note saying he was fed up with life. A similar not was left by his two brothers who took their lives in different incidents in the past three years.
