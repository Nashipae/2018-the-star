Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's daughter Saumu Mbuvi has said claims she stole someone's husband are lies churned by jealous people. The man proposed to her early last week, so we could be seeing her in all white soon. And Saumu, who has been hiding her man's face all along, surprised her followers by revealing it. When she first posted his picture on Instagram, a follower called Olowoshibi1 accused her of husband-snatching, saying: "God is watching you. God will never bless you for snatching another woman's husband." But speaking to Word Is, Saumu said the allegations were baseless. "The man was not married. He was single and I was single too, but maybe he was just somebody's ex, like I was also somebody's ex," she said. Saumu recounted her history with the man and where the two met. "He is a businessman and I met him when I was traveling to the US. We exchanged numbers and started talking even when I came back," she said, adding that things picked up from there. "He has never been married. Maybe he was ever in a relationship, like I was before. People are always jealous, and those negative things are just from people who are jealous." Saumu hopes to wed soon but chose to keep the dates and details about her big day under cover. "The wedding is confidential because I do not want to be so obvious like everyone else. I want it to be a surprise but it is there." Before her new bae, Saumu was in a relationship with Benson Gatu and had a child with him. But the mother of one said she and her baby daddy are no longer together, citing infidelity as the reason behind their split.
