The construction  of a Sh6 billion southern sypass in Eldoret has stalled due to a land compensation dispute. The road will stretch from Cheplaskei to Maili Tisa. More than 1,000 people who will be displaced by the project have raised queries. Landowners where the road will pass accuse the National Land Commission of delaying compensation. The bypass is expected to ease traffic in Eldoret town. Landowner Joseph Samoei said they will stop any work on the project until they are paid. “We signed agreements with the National Land Commission, but a year later we are not being told what is happening,” he said at a landowners meeting in Eldoret town on Thursday. “They advised us not to plant trees on the land.” The NLC has tried to resolve some of the issues delaying the project, funded by the African Development Bank and the government. NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri was in Eldoret last week. He said the dispute will be resolved soon. “In a few weeks, we would have agreed on the way forward so the project can take off,” Swazuri said at the Kerio Valley Development Authority. The NLC sent experts, including surveyors, to Eldoret for a month to resolve compensation woes, some of which Swazuri said were family land disputes. Swazuri said, “We are determined to ensure it gets completed as planned.” Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has asked the Kenya National Highway Authority to put up a dual carriageway as had been planned, instead of changing the design. A team from African Development Bank led by executive director Weggoro Nyamajeje, Kenha and Treasury officials met with Mandago to discuss the dispute. Weggoro said, “We will construct a dual carriage bypass to cope with Eldoret congestion.” President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned construction of the project before the last election.
