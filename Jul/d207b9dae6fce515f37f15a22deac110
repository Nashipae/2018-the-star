A man in Nyeri slashed his wife to death and hanged himself at their home in Iteme-ini Sub-location, Othaya on Sunday night. The bodies of Waikwa Ndekeo and his wife Gathoni were discovered on Monday morning by their son. The boy, a student at Kiamuya secondary, said he knocked on his parents door but received no response. Gathoni had multiple deep cuts all over her body. "The boy called his grandmother who after peeping through the window, saw the woman lying in a pool of blood while his father was hanging from the roof," a neighbour said. It is said the two have been having domestic quarrels. The woman had returned from her parents’ home just two weeks ago following regular disagreements with the husband. The bodies were taken to Mukurwe-ini Hospital mortuary. A week ago, residents protested the killing of a man whose body was found dumped in a cattle dip in Karima ward. Another man was also killed three months ago and his body dumped at the same cattle dip. Click here for the latest political news
