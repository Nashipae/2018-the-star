A herdsman who hacked his employer to death in Ziwa, Uasin Gishu county, has been sentenced to death by an Eldoret court. Phillip Samoei, a Ugandan, killed James Misoi with a panga on February 13, 2016. Several other family members were injured. Samoei stole a tractor worth Sh1 million from the home after the killing. Chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa ruled that the prosecution had proved the case against the accused, who fled to Uganda after the incident before he was arrested by police. Obulutsa said Samoei breached his employerâ€™s trust.
