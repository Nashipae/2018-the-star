Two police officers were shot and wounded on Thursday when suspected al Shabaab militants ambushed their Land Cruiser on Lamu-Garsen road in Milihoi area. Coast region police commander Noah Mwivanda said the officers had been heading to Mpeketoni from Lamu. Mwivanda said the attackers fired at them, seemingly aware that they would be using that route. He said the police car and a private vehicle were torched during the incident at about 2.45pm. "The two officers were taken to Mpeketoni hospital and might need referrals due to their injuries," he said. "Officers are currently locked in a standoff with the suspected militants but we are winning." The commander said the owner of the torched private car had not been accounted for but that police were searching for him. He said they had not identified the type of car it was. Tens of officers from the KDF and regular police were deployed to the area. Many security officers and civilians, including Public Works PS Mariam el Maawy, her niece and four bodyguards, have died in Milihoi in attacks by the terrorists. The latest ambush took place just metres from a GSU camp recently opened as part of efforts to prevent attacks.
