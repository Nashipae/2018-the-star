The Nyeri government will hire 126 healthcare workers to reduce the staff shortage. The staff will be hired in different cadres and will be posted in all public health facilities in the county. They include nurses, clinical officers, lab technicians, health records and information officers, nutritionists, pharmaceutical technologists, social workers, plaster technicians, community oral health officers and accountants. “An advert of the vacancies will soon be placed in the press,” Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga said on Friday. The county government is also considering hiring seven radiographers. The governor spoke when he presided over the official opening of a two-day Nyeri County Clinical Officer’s Symposium at White Rhino Hotel, in Nyeri town. The conference attracted about 200 clinical officers from health facilities in the county – both private and public. Kahiga said his government is ready to improve public health facilities and working environment. The symposium comes a month ahead of the National Universal Health Coverage conference set for September 11-13. Nyeri county is one of the four counties which have been selected for piloting the Universal Health Coverage, which is one of the Big Four agenda. Other counties are Kisumu, Machakos and Isiolo. Present during the conference were Kenya Clinical Officers Association secretary general George Gibore and Nyeri branch chairman Peter Ndirangu.
