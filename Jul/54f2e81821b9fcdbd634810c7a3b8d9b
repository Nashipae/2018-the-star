National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale has told elected leaders to stop blackmailing independent institutions mandated to fight graft. He was reacting to the Council of Governor’s criticism of the arrest of Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong on abuse of office charges. There have also been calls for immunity from prosecution for governors, deputy governors and others while in office. Speaking in Garissa town on Sunday, Duale said the governors “are out of order” in seeking immunity from prosecution. The CoG wants governors granted immunity against prosecution, like the President. Duale said Ojaamong was not the first governor to be arraigned. “The Constitution and the law are very clear, that the only person who enjoys immunity from prosecution is the President only. You cannot equate a governor to the President,” he said. Duale said the buck stops with the governors as they are the CEOs of the counties. He said they should be held directly responsible for any malpractices and economic crimes committed in their counties. “There is no special treatment for the governors when they are being arrested. They should not expect any at all. The way an ordinary citizen is arrested is the same way a high-profile figure will be arrested,” Duale said. He said the DPP, the EACC, the Auditor General, the Controller of Budget, the DCI and other independent bodies should not be blackmailed, intimidated or threatened.
