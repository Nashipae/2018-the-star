Kitui senator Enock Wambua has said  Wiper is willing to work with Deputy President William Ruto ahead of the 2022 election. Wambua, however, said they would ensure party leader Kalonzo Musyoka gets the top seat. The senator spoke in Mwingi yesterday. “We cannot avoid working with the DP because he is one of the top leaders in Jubilee,” Wambua said. He referred to Opposition leader Raila Odinga’s remarks on why Kalonzo and Ruto were left out of his March 9 handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta. On June 10, Raila said in Kitui they were locked out because of their 2022 presidential ambitions. He spoke during the opening of a hotel belonging to Prof Makau Mutua. “These remarks show Raila and Uhuru will not vie for President in 2022. I feel  since the MoU between Raila and Kalonzo is intact, Raila will  back Kambas, “ he said.
