The body of a boy who drowned last evening was pulled out of the water at Nyali Beach in Mombasa county on Sunday morning. Kisauni OCPD Sangura Musee said it was found floating where the person was seen last. “We are yet to identify him. He was with friends when the accident occurred," he told the Star by phone, adding the body was taken to Coast General Hospital morgue. The boy struggled to stay afloat until about 5.30 pm when he was last seen waving his hand for assistance. He and a friend, who was rescued, had played football at the beach before before going to swim. A search was called off on Saturday due to poor lighting and high tides. Reports indicate that at least one person dies every weekend
while swimming at this beach.  Resident Salim Bakari said bodies
are usually recovered after two days, far from the accident zones. Musee, however, said he was not aware of the trend. In Lamu, a student went missing last Friday in a suspected case of drowning. The electrical engineering student was in a group of about 30 students from Lamu Polytechnic who had gone to Shela beach.
