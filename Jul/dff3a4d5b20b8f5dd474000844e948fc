Saboti MP Caleb Hamisi (pictured) has threatened to move a motion to impeach Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen over his slur on President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. Last week, Murkomen claimed Raila influenced Mau Forest evictions, saying the Opposition chief was banking on the conservation efforts to sabotage deputy President William Ruto’s 22 presidential bid. The Elgeyo Marakwet senator said Uhuru’s handshake with Raila on March 9 was to blame for the Mau evictions. Speaking at Madende Catholic Church on Sunday, Hamisi said Murkomen can no longer be trusted with leadership positions. “I will move a motion to the effect that Murkomen doesn’t deserve to be a leader,” Hamisi said. He asked Murkomen to to respect to the two leaders. Hamisi was with Busia woman representative Florence Mutua and Kiambu’s Gathoni Wamuchomba. “I will also move a motion that no elected leader should be arrested,” Hamisi said. Wamuchomba said Uhuru and Raila deserve respect. She said Murkomen’s remarks were not in good faith.
