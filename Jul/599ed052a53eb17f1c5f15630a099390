The Employment and Labour Relations court has reinstated sacked Kenya Re managing director Jadiah Mwaraniah. Justice Byram Ongaya has further directed the government to pay the official salaries and allowances for the months he has been out of office. The judge has also directed the Kenya Re board not to interfere with Mwaraniah's terms of employment. In the ruling, the judge said the official was unfairly removed from office and that the claims of gross misconduct levelled against him remain unsubstantiated. Mwarania had earlier claimed that attempts to
remove the board chairman and two directors are what cost him his job. The CEO’s exit was announced through a Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) notice. The notice indicated that Michael Mbeshi, the reinsurer’s property
management general manager, would take over as acting managing director. Click here for the latest political news
