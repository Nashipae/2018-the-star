Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula has lauded MPs for rejecting a joint report by the agriculture and trade committees on Sugar that was presented on Thursday. Addressing the press in his Kanduyi home on Friday, Wetangula said the report was shallow and did not hold any water on the matter that has left many Kenyans worried and has threatened the economy of sugar cane growing regions. "We in Bungoma, Kakamega, Busia, Siaya, Kisumu, Kericho, Homa Bay, Migori, Nandi and Narok we are very disturbed with the massive importation of sugar that is said to be unfit for consumption by unscrupulous business people but licensed by the ministry of finance,’ he said. The senator noted that the ‘bad’ sugar already in the market will last for two or three years and will make factories like Chemilili, Muhoroni, Nzoia and others to have no opportunity to produce sugar and put in the market.

The senator said that the country has enough laws to deal with economic saboteurs, smugglers and people who circumvent procedures regulations and laws and allow substandard and unfit and goods for consumption to enter into our markets ‘We know that the country is very serious now for a change on the war against corruption by dealing with error and characters working at Kenya bureau and standards who clear substandard goods to enter the country,’ he added The Ford Kenya party leader said that Kenyans want to see more heads rolling in the customs departments on people who clear these contraband goods. ‘I was the first senator to make a statement on this contraband sugar and I repeat that we want to see serious steps taken by the state and ensure no stone is left unturned on those who imported the contraband sugar.’ he said.
