Forgotten man Kevin Omondi showed he still got his match-winning instincts as a much changed Gor Mahia side proved too strong for fellow top flight side Posta Rangers, comfortably edging them 3-1 to book their place in the last eight of the Sportpesa Shield. Omondi, a darling of the crowd, has been used sparingly by coach Dylan Kerr but his two goals scored on either side of half-time were enough too see of an experienced Posta side, who must surely be getting sick at the sight of the ten-time Shield winners after being thrashed 5-0 in the league early last month. It was Posta, who had the first real goal-scoring opportunity when Titus Achesa picked out Dennis Mukaisi who saw his effort come off the upright with Shaban Odhonji well beaten. The rebound fell to Simon Mbugua whose effort was cleared off the line by Cercidy Okeyo. That proved to be Posta’s only chance of the first half. K’Ogalo on the other hand, created several opportunities but it was for an error by Jockins Atudo that they took the lead. The hard-man was out-muscled by Omondi who calmly slotted the ball past Brian Baraza 10 minutes before the break. The Gor number 14 needed only 10 second half minutes to double Gor’s lead when he beat Baraza from a tight angle to leave Rangers staring at elimination. Though substitute Paul Odhiambo gave them hopes of an unlikely comeback in the 63rd minute. Samuel Onyango quickly snuffed out that possibility by netting K’Ogalo’s third goal seven minutes later to take Gor to the last eight alongside holders AFC Leopards, last years losing finalists Kariobangi Sharks, former winners Sofapaka, Tusker and Ulinzi Stars as well as second division side Police and unheralded River Plate.
