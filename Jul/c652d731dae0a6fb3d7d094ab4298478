Former US President Barack Obama has challenged youths in K'Ogello to explore other sporting activities like basketball instead of the dominant soccer. He said his desire for basketball shaped him to be who he is today. "I didn't know my father that much. And as a young African boy without a person to call your role model, you can get lost. However while in Huawei, there was this great team by the name the Fabulous five that looked like a god to me. It was made of tall strong African American men who stirred the enthusiasm in me to pick up on basketball," he said. He spoke while he launched a basketball court at the Sauti Kuu Centre on Monday. "One day I visited my father shortly during Christmas and he gave me a basketball as a gift but I did not know it would influence me that much," Obama said.

"Soccer is a great training sport but give basketball a chance. Don't play it for show off but train to score and make a great team," Obama said. As I have said I had no father, this game became a refuge and an equaliser to many life imbalances, he added. "Just like any sport in the field, it does not matter who you know, who your father is and how much money you have but whether you can play and prove yourself. This will earn you respect," he said. He said his love for basketball has ever remained even after he realised he wasn't made to be a professional player. "It is not a sport for boys only but girls are just as good as strong, competitive and able," he added. He said the game will provide an opportunity for the youth to develop discipline, get better citizens who will focus on positive values.
