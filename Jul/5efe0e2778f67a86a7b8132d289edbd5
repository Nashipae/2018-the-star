Team Kenya had a rough night in Lagos, Nigeria, on Monday as they had to share limited hotel rooms and beds, with at least three on each one. Organisers of the 2018 Africa Senior Championships could not offer charter flights to take the Kenya, Uganda, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Burundi, Botswana and Cameroon teams to Asaba, the event venue. The Ivory Coast team spent 36 hours at Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Ikeja before finding accommodation. The event had been set for Lagos but the Local Organising Committee changed the venue to Asaba and with this came the responsibility of ferrying delegations. Over 60 Kenyan athletes are expected to take part in the championships from August 1 to 5. Kenya was ranked second overall on the medal chart in the last edition of the event two years ago in Durban, South Africa. The country bagged eight gold, eight silver and eight bronze medals. Host South Africa reigned supreme with 33 medals, while Nigeria werethird with 16 medals. Read: Nigeria ready to host Africa senior championships Click here for the latest political news
