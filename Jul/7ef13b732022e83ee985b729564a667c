Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang’ has faulted Jubilee leaders for criticising Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen on the Mau evictions. Kajwang’ yesterday said Jubilee should instead remove Murkomen from the Senate position for contradicting the government’s agenda. Murkomen said opposition leader Raila Odinga is behind the evictions in the spirit of the handshake. “Some people who joined the government through the backdoor are working to remove people from Mau,” Murkomen said. Kajwang’ said senators should not criticise Murkomen in press conferences, yet they can remove him. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said Murkomen should instead find a solution to the Mau problem.
