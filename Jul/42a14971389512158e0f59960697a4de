Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed has asked head teachers to ensure their schools adhere to the 8am - 5pm program as outlined in the ministry's policy. Amina said lack of flexibility in the school programming has put pressure on students, a situation she says is one of the causes of school unrest. "As we maintain UN standards, lets ensure that we do not overstretch the child. We know there are children who go to school as early as 5am and are taught after 5pm. This is denying them time to play and be children," the CS said. She made the observation when she appeared before the Committee on Education on Tuesday. The CS further raised concern over schools in rural areas where children are at risk of being attack since they are forced to report to class very early in the morning.

We call upon the parents to ensure they live on a day break," Amina said. On Moi Girls, Amina said she was satisfied with the measures put to normalise learning at the institution which was hit by claims of rape targeting students. She cited the removal of kiosks around the perimeter wall as one of the measures taken to prevent such occurrences. "We have also dissolved the Board of Management and had an interim team and the parents also elected new PTA team," she added.
