Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu on Saturday launched an empowerment programme in which 120 youths were dispatched to Nakuru for vocational training in tailoring. Youth empowerment was part of Ngilu’s campaign pledges. She said the cohort were part of 4,000 youths her administration targets in a training and job creation programme. The programme is being implemented in partnership with the International Labour Organisation and the National Industrial Training Authority. “We are aiming to train and create jobs for 4,000 youths in the next four years. This programme will ultimately revive and spur growth in the garment-making sector,” Ngilu said. She said the skills will enable youth engage in income-generating activities. At least 1,000 youths are targeted for training every year. THREE PER WARD “As a leader, I have to give youths the skills to earn a living. That will transform the socio-economic welfare of the county,” Ngilu said. She spoke at the Kitui town bus terminus when she commissioned the training of the 120 beneficiaries. The training at the Trendy Technical and Vocational Training Centre in Nakuru will take two months. The beneficiaries will apply the skills at the Syungila Vocational Training Centre in Kitui, where a garment-making factory is being set up. Ngilu said other parts of the county will benefit as more youths get trained. The beneficiaries were nominated by residents through public participation in March. Each of the 40 wards in the county produced three youths. The cohort has 80 women. Ngilu said she hopes the training will mark the first steps in reviving the garment-making industry in Kitui. She pledged to provide training, equipment and financial support to local garment makers.
