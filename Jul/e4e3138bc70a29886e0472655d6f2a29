Deputy President William Ruto yesterday said he has an excellent working relationship with all public servants. He denied claims by his allies that some senior public servants are plotting to stop him from succeeding President Uhuru Kenyatta. Yesterday, the Star reported that Ruto’s close allies believe Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, State House Comptroller Kinuthia Mbugua and Interior Permanent Secretary Karanja Kibicho are frustrating Ruto’s 2022 bid.

At the weekend, Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wa, one of Ruto’s loyal foot-soldiers from Mt Kenya, said the Deputy President’s ICC adversaries are regrouping to fight him. “The same cartel that took you to the ICC, we want to serve them notice today...if we genuinely support Uhuru Kenyatta, we must support you [Ruto] to further the Jubilee agenda,” he said. Those named in the anti-Ruto scheme included Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe among others. Also read: No crisis to warrant Jubilee PG meeting, says Tuju Click here for the latest political news
