It revealed how staff colluded with unregistered companies, or front proxies, to win tenders. Some were pre-qualified despite having no record of legal status. The report exposed money transfers between directors of the pre-qualified firms and KPLC staff. Some employees took money from contractors and shared it with others who could influence the tender process. The report showed how only two members of the Tender Opening Committee were present at the opening of the bids, contrary to Section 78(1) (a) of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act. This law states that the Tender Opening Committee shall have at least three members. A search at the Registrar of Companies offices revealed that 137 firms out of 525 pre-qualified firms submitted CR12 certificates, which were different from those held by the Registrar of Companies.
