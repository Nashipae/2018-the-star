Wiper chairman Kivutha Kibwana has urged Kambas to ensure they are not left out of the next government. The Makueni governor said the tendency by the community to be included in governments that have already been formed should stop. “We now need to change tack. We want to play our cards right this time around. It is not wise to always plead for positions in a government we did not form,” Kibwana said. The governor spoke while inspecting civil works at David Mbiti Wambuli Technical and Vocational College in Mbooni constituency on Friday. Kibwana said the Kamba should be on the winning side. The community should take a strategic position and form coalitions for a winning formula. Get it right He said the community has lost a lot in the 10 years it has been in the Opposition. It risks being doomed further if gets it wrong this time around. “It’s our right as a community to be served by the government. However, in politics there is lobbying. Communities in top positions in government benefit more than others,” Kibwana said. The governor said Kambas have been sidelined from state appointments by the Jubilee administration. KIbwana was accompanied by Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo, speaker Douglas Mbilu and Mbooni MP Erastus Kivasu. The senator backed Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka as the most suitable to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta when he leaves office in 2022. Work with Jubilee Mutula urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to accommodate the Kamba. He, Kibwana and other leaders from the region have been urging Kalonzo to work with Jubilee.
