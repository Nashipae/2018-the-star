The parents of a school boy in Makueni County have called for the punishment of a teacher who allegedly injured him during a punishment. It is said that the learner sustained injuries to his right ankle when the teacher caned him and other boys for not performing their morning duties. He was treated at a local hospital and discharged. The boy's mother has asked education officials and other local authorities to ensure justice for him. She claimed that there had been attempts to cover up the case as she learned that medics were told the boy fell. When the Star visited their home on Tuesday, the boy's grandfather expressed fear that justice will not be served. "It is eminent that they want
to conceal the fact that the boy was injured by a teacher. That's why they
told medics that he fell while playing," he said, adding the family was being taken for granted due to poverty. The boy has not attended classes since he got injured. The school's head teacher said he reported the matter at the area's education office. "I advised the teacher to take care of the hospital bill while the matter is investigated," he told the Star at his office on Tuesday. "I have reported the matter to
my seniors. I believe action will be taken if the teacher is found culpable." Click here for the latest political news
