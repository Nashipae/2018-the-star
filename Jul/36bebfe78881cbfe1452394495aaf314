Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina has urged politicians to stop engaging in endless politics and serve Kenyans. The senator spoke during a funds drive on Sunday to offset a hospital bill for Simon Wambugu. The Nyeri businessman was shot by thugs and succumbed to injuries while undergoing treatment. Maina told Nyeri residents to shun leaders who practice divisive politics. He said Kenyans need a united country to prosper. “Let us not focus on too much politics to the extent of forgeting to perform our duties as leaders. Kenyans have high expectations. We must deliver the promises we made,” he said. Maina said leaders should support President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda. He told leaders to avoid corruption and ensure public funds are utilised properly. Maina called on churches to join the fight against graft. He said theft of public funds was derailing development. “The people of Nyeri support the President in the war on graft. Thieves must be sent to jail,” he said. The senator also backed a lifestyle audit for all public officers. He said Kenyans need to know how public servants make their wealth. “If you own a vehicle, a plane or a big house but we do not know what you do for a living, then you must be followed up to explain the source,” he said. Maina said many Kenyans are suffering, they live below the poverty line because funds have been syphoned from public coffers and diverted. The senator told Nyeri residents he would have a discussion with security officials and other leaders to find a solution for rising crime in the county. Maina advised security officials to set up an information desk where residents can be give confidential information. He emphasised that the police need to build confidence with members of the public. People do not volunteer information for fear of being exposed by police officers, the senator said.
