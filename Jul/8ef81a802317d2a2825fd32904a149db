The Uasin Gishu government has put on notice private developers who have built houses on riparian land and drainages in Eldoret town estates. Roads executive Gideon Birir said the developers are to blame for blockage of drainage systems. He said the devolved units’ efforts to open up the drainages during downpours has been hampered by the developers who continue to put up high-rise buildings. The county, Birir said, will enforce the Wayleaves Act to open drainages. He spoke at Elgon View estate where he led a team of county officials from Kenya Rural Roads Authority during inspection of impassable roads in Kesses constituency. Birir was accompanied by area MP Swarup Mishra who is also the vice chairperson of the National Assembly Health Committee. Birir said the county government will spend Sh3 million to repair the road linking Annex Estate and Eldoret International Airport. The estate was among areas identified by the county and national government as flooding hotspots.
