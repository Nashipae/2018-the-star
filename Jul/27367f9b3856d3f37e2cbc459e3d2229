Lucy Ngirita, the mother of four key suspects in the Sh486 million NYS case, left remand yesterday after immigration solved her passport hitch. Wambui had on several occasions appeared before court attempting to have her sureties approved, but only got her freedom 44 days after she and her children were arrested. She posted Sh1 million bail and surrendered a vehicle, in compliance with the terms placed by the High Court in June. Her children, Ann Wanjiku, Phyllis Njeri, Jeremiah Gichini and his wife Catherine Mwai will however stay longer in remand, together with 16 other NYS suspects, as the verification of their sureties is yet to begin. The DCI is yet to scrutinise their sureties, while others have been turned away by the court for various reasons, prolonging the verification process. Out of the 48 suspects charged in May, 31 have been freed on bail after being subjected to a stringent verification process by investigators. Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji asked investigators to carefully scrutinise the documents forwarded by suspects to ensure they are not proceeds of crime. PS Lillian Omollo, former NYS director general Richard Ndubai, former acting director of finance Wellington Lubira, former head of accounts at the Youth ministry Sammy Mbugua, former director of administration Michael Ojiambo, and former head of procurement at Mechanical Transport Branch Rodgers Nzioka are among suspects out on bail. Others are businessman James Thuita, Evone Wanjiku, Peter Kimani, Kenneth Mwathi, Peter Muritu, Lucas Otieno, Josephat Njoroge, Clara Mbao and Andrine Nyambura.The pre-trial conference will be held on July 17.
