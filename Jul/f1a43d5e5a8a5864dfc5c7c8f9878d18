The Nakuru county government on Friday started opening blocked access roads leading to Lake Naivasha. The county assembly passed a motion directing that residents and visitors be allowed to use the roads. The Trade and Tourism committee had accused investors of blocking the roads. It ordered they be compelled to unblock them. The motion was first tabled by Lakeview ward representative Karanja Mburu and was supported by the majority of the assembly members. Mburu said it was wrong for unemployed youths to loiter in Naivasha, yet the lake would provide an opportunity for them to earn a living through fishing or tourism activities. He thanked his colleagues for passing the motion. It also requires the county and other government agencies to investigate and punish those who blocked the roads. “Now they have the opportunity to voluntarily open the roads. If they fail the law will take its course,” Mburu said. The first-term ward representative said they will open and market the access routes for tourists to provide revenue to the county. “These corridors are blocked by hoteliers, flower growers and real estate developers. It will no longer be business as usual,” he said. “We can’t let our people walk for 30km to access the lake, yet the corridors are a kilometre away from estates.” Friends of Lake Naivasha Lobby chairman Fredrick Muthui said the opening of the corridors will mark a new beginning and end problems faced by residents. He supported the assembly’s decision. He said the lake has 19 corridors around it but only one was in use. A High Court ruling blocking its use had put matters into disarray, he said. Mburu said prominent traders had grabbed the corridors and were “working in cahoots with government officials to hold on to an illegality”. “We’ve had several parliamentary committees visit this area. We always take them round, but their reports have never been made public,” he said.
