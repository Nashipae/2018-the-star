As coaches eye maximum points in the remaining 11 SportPesa Premier League matches, Chemelil Sugar head coach Charles Odera targets only four wins to relieve his relegation fears. Chemelil are placed 14th with 24 points—five above the red line and Odera believes 12 points will be sufficient for them to maintain their top flight status which has been threatened by massive exodus of senior players and dry coffers. The Awasi-based sugar millers watched 19 players leave during the June transfer window but Odera remains optimistic despite the exodus —placing his hope in new signings whom he brought in as replacements. He is tipping the new signings to save the club from the shame of sinking to the National Super League. Having gone 12 matches without a win, a 1-0 win over Nzoia Sugar and a draw against Nakumatt in the past two matches has renewed their hopes of remaining in the top flight league. Odera said the four points gained left no doubt that the new players had gelled well. Odera, a former player and skipper for the millers, who was hired in April to replace Patrick Odhiambo who crossed to Sony Sugar, has set his target on four home wins and draws in away matches as his minimum requirement. He said: “I just want four home wins in the remaining matches and at least a draw in the away matches. We stand a chance of finishing in the top ten. I am not under pressure to stay in the league but I believe the players have what it takes to fight for their survival. Losing 19 players is not easy but the new players have gelled and the four points we collected in our past two matches is an indication the chemistry in the playing unit is working.”
