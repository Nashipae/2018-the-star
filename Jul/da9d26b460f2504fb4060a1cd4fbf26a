Madini, a fast-rising coastal artiste, says unlike some artistes, he is not in need of a socialite to push his music. "People have asked me to do that, but I don't think it's the right thing to do. I'm doing good music and I believe I'll get fans with it," Madini said. But was he talking about his frenemy Otile Brown? "I haven't talked about anyone. What he and Vera Sidika are doing is their own strategy, I can't follow the same way," he said. Madini is currently making headlines with the song Nilivyo, featuring Kenya's finest Vivian. "I always wanted to do a collabo with Vivian, so when we linked up, we brainstormed and came up with this song," he said.
