Stakeholders have called for implementation of the tea hawking ban to organise the sector. A meeting held in Murang’a town and attended by traders from Kiambu, Murang’a, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Embu, Meru and Tharaka Nithi said hawking was encouraging theft in farms and selling centres. Participants said theft was rampant in Kiambu and Murang’a and it was fast-spreading to Meru, Kirinyaga and Nyeri. Kenya Tea Development Agency said hawking was lowering their output.

Macharia blamed the tea directorate saying it licenced new tea processing companies which were encouraging hawking. representatives from Meru and Tharaka Nithi said the counties had called for a total ban. Private companies pay farmers an average of Sh22 per kilogram of green leaf while KTDA pays Sh14 with an annual bonus. The authority said private buyers were luring farmers with daily payments as opposed to its monthly payments. “These easy payments have split many families as farmers struggle to plan on how to spend the cash,” Macharia said. Private buyers defended hawking saying they were expanding the market. Njeru Industries official David Maina said they were providing health competition that gave farmers an alternative market. The industry processes tea in Meru. “We bought tea worth Sh100 million from small scale farmers in Murang’a last year. How can that be classified as illegal?” Maina said. Agriculture Food Authority interim director Antony Muriithi said farmers should be affiliated to licensed tea processors.
