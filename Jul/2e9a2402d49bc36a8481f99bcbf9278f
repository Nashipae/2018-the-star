Activist Okiya Omtatah yesterday opposed the Supreme Court’s involvement in a petition to give an advisory on Constitution Chapter Six on integrity. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights wants the apex court to give its opinion on the chapter on leadership and integrity. It sought a clear standard to measure aspirants seeking public offices — appointive and elective. The KNCHR questioned whether those adversely mentioned in reports by constitutional commissions and independent offices should be disqualified from holding public positions. Yesterday, Omtatah told a seven-judge bench led by CJ David Maraga that the court lacks jurisdiction and cannot be involved in the case. He said the KNCHR lacked the legal right to institute the ‘appeal’. In his preliminary objections, Omtatah said the application for an advisory cannot proceed because similar cases are pending before the High Court. The commission, through its lawyers, said the issues raised were not the subject of lower court proceedings, hence, not an appeal to the decisions that have been rendered as claimed by Omtatah. “The advisory opinion is not an appeal. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to give its advisory as stipulated in the Constitution,” it said in its submissions. The lawyers said the issues raised in the advisory reference are a matter of great public importance. They said it concerns provisions that greatly affect the governance of public institutions. The court will deliver its ruling on Omtatah’s objections on notice.
