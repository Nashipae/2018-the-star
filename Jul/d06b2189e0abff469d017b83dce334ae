Disaster management officials on Thursday recovered the body of a worker who went missing after a quarry collapsed in Njiru on Saturday. 39-year-old Stephen Githinji's body was found at the Silanga quarry after a search by officers attached to the National Disaster Management Unit. NDMU deputy director Pius Masai said the site remains officially closed and will not be openned for the public for safety reasons. The body was later taken to the mortuary after it was identified by family members. Githinji remained trapped in the quarry after over 30 people were rescued following the Saturday incident. "The rescue team tried its best to find the trapped worker. It was challenging because of the rocky surface and proximity to the railway line," Masai said. The Kenya Defence Forces, Nairobi County Disaster Management Unit , Kenya Red Cross Society and the disaster response unit have been on the ground since Saturday. Nairobi county government says the quarry was illegal. "People sneak in at night to do illegal business. Accessing the place is not easy," Embakasi North county administrator Stephen Kosgey said. Since the incident occurred, several quarries have been closed over safety concerns. Click here for the latest political news
