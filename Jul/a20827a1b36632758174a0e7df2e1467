Jamia Mosque Imam Sheikh Muhammad Swalihu wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to nominate a Muslim as ambassador to Saudi Arabia. In his Friday sermon, the Nairobi Imam said having a Muslim envoy will ensure national interests are aptly taken care of. Swalihu said a Muslim ambassador will be better placed to handle hajj affairs as there are important cities in Saudi Arabia whose access is limited to Muslims. Drawing a parallel with the Vatican, he said diplomatic postings by several countries are mainly reserved for Catholics due to its religious importance. "The same principles should be applied to Saudi Arabia due to its religious significance," he said. His views were echoed by ambassador Yusuf Nzibo, who is Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims chairman, who said it is not in the best interest of the country for non-Muslims to be ambassador and deputy ambassador to the Riyadh mission. "The postings to Saudi Arabia are unfair to Muslims. We just can't have both ambassadors and number two as non-Muslims. There are areas and cities where they will not be able to go," he said in a letter to Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Ambassador Macharia Kamau. "As things stand, this will cause a lot of constraints within the Muslim community." Peter Oginga will be Kenya's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, should his nomination be approved by the National Assembly.
