New KCC has increased milk prices for farmers as it consolidates its position as a central player in the dairy sector. CEO Nixon Sigei yesterday said they have increased the prices from about Sh36 a litre to between Sh38 and Sh40. The figures increase farmers’ incomes and tighten competition between the state-owned firm and Brookeside — the current market leader. Brookside recently increased its producer prices to Sh37 a litre. The new prices set by New KCC will be the highest in the market. Sigei said that since they began modernising their factories, their market share has risen to 35 per cent. "Modernisation has given us the leverage to improve our performance as we work closely with producers so we move forward together," Sigei told the Star in Eldoret. He said that in the past three years, they have improved capacity, efficiency and payment to farmers, who now earn about Sh5 billion yearly from the Sh2.5 billion they got previously. Sigei said the company plays a critical role in stabilising raw milk prices and its new systems put it at a vantage point, as it seeks to take control of the market. They used more than Sh400 million to refurbish the Eldoret factory. The factory has a new UHT milk production facility — one of the largest for the company. Sigei said upgrade of other factories is underway. Repairs at Dandora and Sotik factories are almost complete and they will be commissioned next month, he said. "Phase three of modernisation at Kinganjo and Kitale is ongoing," Sigei said. The latest statistics from the Kenya Dairy Board (KDB) show the difference between the New KCC and Brookside in market control of raw milk is about five per cent. New KCC had 23 per cent share but now has 35, while Brookside Dairies’ current share is about 40 per cent. Vendors still take up a huge portion of the raw milk directly to the market, but the KDB is still educating the consumers to ensure the milk they use is processed.
