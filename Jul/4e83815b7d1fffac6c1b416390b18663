Educationists in Embu East subcounty have urged the government to take action against parents who do not take their disabled children to school. They said some parents have been hiding children with disabilities at home for fear of stigmatisation. “Some are ashamed of their disabled children. The government should crack the whip on such parents through the relevant authorities,” Robert Njeru said. Catherine Wanja, an early childhood development expert and a primary school head teacher, said some parents fail to take their children to school because they think they do not need education. “We want to tell such parents that it is the right of every child to get an education,” Wanja said. They spoke at a meeting to discuss the issue at the weekend. The tutors asked the county to build more special schools to cater for children living with disabilities. “We challenge all leaders in the county to support us in this struggle. It is in school where these children can get self-enhancing skills.” Kyeni North MCA Patrick Mukavi, who is the assembly’s Education committee vice chairman, said every child has a right to an education, whether they are disabled or not. “Parents must not feel ashamed of having disabled children. They should educate them because this could be their door to prosperity. Disability is not inability,” Mukavi said. He promised to move a motion to compel the county to develp systems that will ensure every disabled child in goes to school. The MCA urged the relevant authorities to join hands to ensure access to education by all. He urged residents to volunteer information of parents hiding their disabled children to the department of Children’s Services and the police. A joint report by the Kenya Institute of Special Education and the Ministry of Education conducted between 2016 and 2017 showed Kenya is still ill-equipped to support disabled learners.
