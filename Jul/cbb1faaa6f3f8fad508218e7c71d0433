Majority of Machakos MCAs have insisted they will not recognise the seven CECs appointed by Governor Alfred Mutua on Friday last week. "We wish to categorically state that the recently appointed team of CECs by Governor Mutua are in office illegally," the MCAs, largely from Wiper, said. In a statement on Wednesday, they said the swearing-in of the officials portrayed impunity against the residents of Machakos. Majority leader Mark Muendo called for nullification of the appointments saying Mutua had misquoted the law to justify the appointments. He said the 21 days provided for in the Constitution to vet the nominees had not elapsed as claimed by Mutua. "The 21 sitting days will lapse on August 8. This is in accordance with our current Assembly calendar." "We hereby request the Governor to be observant of the law and to immediately abide by the Constitution and cancel the illegal appointments," he said. The executive, however, disputed the claims by the MCA's that they have only met for 14 sittings. Mutua's spokesperson and communication director Mutinda Mwanzia termed the claims as untrue and blatantly wrong. "Records in our possession show that the members have earned allowances of over a number of sittings during the period in question," Mutinda said. The names were presented on May 17 and the time lapsed on June 29 as per the Hansard records of sittings and order papers.

Governor Mutua appointed seven CECs on Friday after the county assembly allegedly failed to approve the names within 21 days as stipulated under the Appointments Act.
