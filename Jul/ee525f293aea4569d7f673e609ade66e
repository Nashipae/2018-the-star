The Kenyan government will pay 16 foreign transport companies a whooping Sh6.3 billion as compensation following destruction of their properties during post -election chaos 10 years ago. The government will compensate businessmen from Uganda and Rwanda whose trucks were torched by demonstrators during the 2007-8 violence that broke out when Mwai Kibaki was declared winner of the hotly contested presidential poll. Justice Msagha Mbogholi said the traders proved their cases “jointly and severally” so the government cannot run away from liability. The judge said there is no doubt the traders lost their businesses but noted that it was hard to determine how long those vehicles would have remained on the road. “ The petitioners have established, on a balance of probability, loss of goods and are therefore entitled to not only the damage as a result of their trucks' destruction but also the value of goods destroyed as a result of the government’s negligence” the judge said. Among the companies to benefit are Kampala City Traders Association, Intraspeed Logistic, willex Uganda ,KPI Ltd and Katraco Uganda. Others who took the government to court for negligence are Dooba Enterprises, , Sebco Uganda, Bunyonyi Safaris, Seven Hills Impex, Uganda Agricultural Tools, Board City and Bidco Uganda . Businessman Tom Mgenga, the owner of Mugenga Holdings, and David Musana  Suleiman Bateganya will go home smiling too. The Court agreed with their argument that their businesses ought to have been protected. The court was of the view that the long distance drivers, who were then ferrying the goods from Mombasa to Congo, Rwanda and Uganda, suffered loss and thus deserve to be compensated.
