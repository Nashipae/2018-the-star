Trizah Njeri, the widow of marathoner Samuel Wanjiru gave contradictory evidence yesterday leading to the adjournment of an inquest into his mysterious death. Njeri could not tell the corrects facts relating to their properties, even though she maintained that a Nakuru court has given her rights to manage a huge part of Wanjiru’s vast estate. She told chief magistrate Francis Andayi a succession suit that had been filed against her before the High Court in Nakuru by Judy Wambui – another woman who claims to have sired a child with Wanjiru - was ruled in her favour. While adjourning the case, the magistrate observed that the hearing has dragged on for five years. He said it must end before the end of the year. Six witnesses are yet to testify. The inquest was pushed to September 12. Among the properties she said are under her control are houses in Nyahururu and 15 others in Nakuru, where she collects Sh200,000 in rent per month. Wanjiru died on May 15, 2011, aged 24. The couple allegedly fought over a woman minutes before his body was found in a pool of blood at their Nyahururu home. Yesterday, Njeri could not explain about other properties, including a house in Ngong. She said her mother-in-law, Hannah Wanjiru, owns other properties.
