KNH advertised a separate tender for ICT services because it had not fully understood the scope of healthcare information technology fronted by the government, the Health PS said yesterday. A similar tender worth Sh4.7 billion had been advertised by the Health ministry and awarded to local firm Seven Seas Technologies on October 2 last year. The project was expected to last for three months. It involved connecting level-5 hospitals and Kenyatta National Hospital with ICT services. PS Peter Tum yesterday told the National Assembly Health committee that KNH cancelled the tender to analyse its requirements against the scope of that being implemented by the ministry. He was responding to Murang'a Woman Representative Sabina Chege who questioned the need for parallel tendering. Meanwhile, Tum said the country has inadequate radiologists and radiographers. “In the 98 hospitals where Managed Equipment Service programme is being implemented, there are only 260 radiographers and 25 radiologists. Full utilisation of equipment in radiology, including X-ray, MRI and CT scans could not be realised,” he said.
