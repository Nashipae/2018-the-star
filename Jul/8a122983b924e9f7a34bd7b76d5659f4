AFC Leopards Supporters’ Sacco will officially be launched on Wednesday next week in Nairobi.
Devolution Cabinet Secretary, Eugene Wamalwa, will be the chief guest during the ceremony set to be held at Railways Club and will be assisted by nominated senator Millicent Omanga and former club patron Cyrus Jirongo. The ceremony will start at 6pm. The Sacco, a brainchild of former AFC Leopards players, will enable members to access business credit, emergency loan, school fees and personal loans among other things.
The Sacco will work closely with the club leadership, fans and other stakeholders to initiate several investment projects. According to Sacco chairman, Maurice Osundwa, they will secure medical covers for legends so that the supporter do not keep fund-raising. In case of death, the insurance will take care of transport, the coffin and a facilitation fee of Sh200,000. Every member will be covered together with five family members. The minimum monthly contribution is Sh500 while the fee and minimum share is Sh2,200 which can be paid through Safaricom pay bill number 206777 while the account number is one’s national ID number. Some of the legends, who have already registered with the Sacco include Josephat Murila, JJ Masiga, Aggrey Lukoye, Patrick Shilasi, Peter Lichungu, Peter Ouma, Mike Amwayi, Justus Muhati, Joe Kadenge, Tonny Lidonde and Reginald Asibwa.
