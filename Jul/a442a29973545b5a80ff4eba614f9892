Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said he will use his influence as a senior politician to ensure the Kamba community is in government. He urged Ukambani leaders on Friday to pursue the correct political paths that will “take us back to government.” “I’ll commit myself to ensuring we don’t lose direction in the next general election,” the Wiper chairman said at David Mbiti Wambuli Technical and Vocational College in Mbooni. The institution will be commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta later in the year. Kibwana called for “purposeful unity” to avoid being left out in the “political cold” in the  future. “I call upon leaders from this region to avoid political rigidity when lobbying for coalitions with other political formations,” he said. Kibwana was accompanied by Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr and Mbooni MP Erustus Kivasu. Kilonzo appealed to Uhuru to ensure Kambas are in “your government” before his term ends. He urged local leader Musau Mwania, said to be friendly with Uhuru, to convey the message. “Go and tell Uhuru that he is welcome in Ukambani. We want to go back in government where we used to be. I know you are good friends and you share so many secrets,” Kilonzo said. He urged the Kamba community to be ready to support Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to succeed President Kenyatta in 2022.
