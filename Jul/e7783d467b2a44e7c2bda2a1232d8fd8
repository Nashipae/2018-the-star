Private sector activity grew at a slightly slower pace in June but showed continued resilience. The Stanbic Kenya Bank Purchasing Managers’ Index released yesterday shows operations in the private sector slowed down to 55.0, the slowest since February. The highest recorded activity was in April at 56.4. The monthly indicator is based on activity in the manufacturing and service sectors with readings above 50 signalling an improvement in business conditions, while any figure below this indicates poor performance. Stanbic economist Jibran Qureishi said the marginal drop was a result of the floods witnessed across the country during the first quarter but assured that the decline should not be a cause for concern. The survey shows firms recruited more labour to meet higher demand while the cost of production eased to the slowest since October 2017. During the review period, new business and export orders registered sharp growth. “There were reports of strong demand in international markets for Kenyan goods and services,” the report said. Those interviewed, however, noted a sharp increase in the cost of goods and services due to a rise in the price of food and fuel. “This reportedly led firms to increase their average selling prices to pass on higher cost burdens to customers,” the report stated. Qureishi said the proposal to repeal the interest rate capping law is a positive move as it would enhance lending to the private sector which has slowed down since the law came into effect in August 2016. “It will unleash some much needed private sector driven stimulus to the economy,” he said.
