Some 48 per cent of school-going children in Samburu are out of school, the area County Director of Education, Zachary Mutwiri has said. Mutwiri attributed the low enrolment to a combination of factors which included cultural practices which preferred the education of boys to girls, and early marriages. Mutwiri, however, blamed the moran ritual for holding boys away from attending school, even though the community prized the value of boys over girls. He made the remarks during the Samburu County Education Day, in Maralal township last Wednesday. He said people should appreciate that a good education helped people and exploit culture to better their living standards instead of retarding it. “It is good to be a Moran, but being an educated Moran is a great thing,” Mutwiri noted.

He said retrogressive cultural practices like FGM and early marriages imposed on children continued to be witnessed in our midst. “The time has come for us to put concerted efforts to address these challenges,” he said. Lenolkulal said, however, that the County Government has supported secondary and tertiary education through bursary and scholarships and the primary level in extra curricula activities including educational tours, music festivals and drama festivals. He said the county government of Samburu has built 280 ECDE classrooms and 110 sanitary blocks in the first five years of devolution, noting that it also recruited 470 ECDE teachers which it deployed to ECDE centres in the County.
