Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja has chosen to address Gikomba, Nyamakima, Kamkunji and Solai problems instead of travelling to Russia to enjoy the World Cup with other lawmakers. Sakaja said so in a text message to the Star as it emerged that at least 20 legislators had gone to Russia at the government's expense. “I cancelled my travel so as to focus on these issues," he said, noting there are more important issues in the county.
