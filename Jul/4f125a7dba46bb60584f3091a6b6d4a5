The Kenya Revenue Authority has frozen the accounts of the Great Lakes University of Kisumu over a Sh95 million debt. Last month, KRA instructed six institutions the university banks with to remit credit to KRA to clear the tax arrears. "In exercise of powers conferred upon me by Section 42 of the Tax Procedure Act 2015, I hereby declare you to be the payer of the amount specified in this notice," Debt enforcement manager Asha Salim said in a letter. Vice-chancellor Atieno Amadi, who took over two years ago, said the university owed KRA Sh117 million in tax arrears but has been paying it in instalments. Amadi said the freeze has hampered the university's operations. The university has sued KRA to have the accounts unfrozen. “The court should allow the university to come into an agreement with KRA on the best way to clear the debt,” the VC said. Amadi said staff have not been paid full salaries since January as a result. Click here for the latest political news
