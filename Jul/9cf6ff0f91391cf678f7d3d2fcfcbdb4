A Kenya Revenue Authority official was on Friday charged for unlawful failure to pay taxes. Beatrice Charo is accused of failing to remit Sh2,780,000 being income earned through commissions. Charo committed the offence between February and September 2016 according to the Anti-corruption commission. She was charged alongside her sister Ann Kabibi. The charge followed a consent from the Director of Public Prosecution. EACC lower Coast regional manager George Ojowi said the two conspired to fraudulently transfer Sh10 million "being proceeds of corruption". The money from Kabibi's account was transferred to Lulu Company Ltd account at Co-operative Banks, Nkrumah Road Branch. The two, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. They were released on a surety bond of Sh1 million each, in addition to cash bail of Sh500,000. Click here for the latest political news
