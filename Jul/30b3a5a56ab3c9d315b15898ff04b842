Kisii Agriculture executive Ezman Onsarigo yesterday urged farmers to form cooperative societies to sell their milk at better prices. He said brokers have been exploiting farmers by buying their produce at throw-away prices. Onsarigo said the county requires more than 200 million litres per year to meet local demand but currently produces 166 million litres. The county has trained farmers to prevent contamination. Onsarigo said Kisii partnered with the national government to buy Sh50 million milk coolers, but four are lying idle because many farmers have yet to form societies. “Only one group in Kiamokama, Nyaribari Masaba, installed one cooler. It has stopped huge losses. Their milk is safe,” Onsarigo said, urging the rest to follow suit.
