Some 39 residents of Garissa on Saturday received free corrective lip and pallet cleft surgery by doctors from the Kenya Society of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. Speaking to reporters on Saturday after completing the three-day exercise at the Garissa Referral Hospital, team leader Dorsi Jowi said many people do not know cleft and pallet deformities can be treated. “These deformities are common in the country but many victims, especially those in the rural areas, have no idea they can be corrected through surgery,” Dr Jowi said. “Many Kenyans belief cleft deformities are an hereditary thing, which is not necessarily the case.” Jowi said the problem can be fixed and urged those with the problem “to stop suffering in silence but instead seek treatment through the camps. ” The medics, mainly attached to the University of Nairobi, Kenyatta National Hospital and Mama Lucy Hospital, organise medical camps outside Nairobi with the aim at decentralising their services. The society refers complicated operations to Nairobi. Respective counties subsidise transport costs and accommodation for patients and relatives.
