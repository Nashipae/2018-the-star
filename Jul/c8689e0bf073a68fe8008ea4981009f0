Gracious Amani is the girl who got Kenyans talking after her rendition of Alicia Key's Girl On Fire went viral. Gracious, whose stage name is Amani G, has been signed under Peter Nduati's Creek Pine records. The 13-year-old is set to release her first collaboration with singer Vivian and gospel singer Pitson. "I'm so excited to be signed. My music is mostly inspirational and is directed to everyone, especially young kids like me, to tell them that there is hope for their dreams," she told Word Is. "I was so happy when Alicia Keys posted me on her Instagram. I was overwhelmed with joy. I never knew a video on social media can be this life-changing. I promise to work hard in school and on my career as well." She is the secondborn in a family of four siblings. Her education is to be catered for until university level by the record label. Her family has also been moved from Githurai following death threats. "There is this day that we heard the door being knocked. My brother answered and was punched by unknown people. They were demanding money after seeing me on TV. Thank God he didn't die."
