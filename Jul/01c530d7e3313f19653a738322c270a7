Sneha Kotecha qualified for the quarter-finals of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) Nairobi Junior Open after beating Courtney Fyvie of South Africa 6-2, 6-1 in the third round at Nairobi Club yesterday. Sneha, who romped to the second leg with a 6-0, 6-0 win over Sophia Piech of Australia in the second round on Monday was no match for her opponent, who struggled to handle her serves and returns. In the boys category, the duo of Albert Njogu and Derrick Ominde sealed places in the third round with wins over Aditya Chowdhury and Youssef Nabil of India and Egypt respectively. Njogu, who is seeded second in the tournament was handed a bye and hence began his bid to better his first leg result in the second round where he edged Chowdhury 6-1, 6-2. Ominde, on the other hand, saw off Nabil 7-5, 7-6(5) to meet his target of a third round. Njogu thanked his coach, Rosemary Owino, whose advice had worked for him. With top seed and Burundian Abdoul Kabura retiring due to illness, the unfortunate incident left Njogu as the most experienced player and thus favourite to win the tournament. "I am happy for the win. I think my coach deserves the credit. She advised and encouraged me to play to the best of my capabilities and avoid committing simple errors. It’s sad to see Kabura retire due to illness. He was my partner for the doubles. He leaves me as the top seeded player on paper but that doesn’t mean I will emerge the winner. I just want to play to the coach’s instructions and in line with my target."
