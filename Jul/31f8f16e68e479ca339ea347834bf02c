Nine students from Homa Bay are being held at Manga Children’s Home in Kisii while 15 others are under investigation for arson. The learners from three secondary schools are accused of causing destruction of property. The nine suspects include six from Gendia Boys’ High School and three from Kandiege Mixed Secondary School. On Monday, they were taken to the Oyugis law courts and charged with burning dormitories. They pleaded not guilty and were granted Sh100,000 bond or Sh30,000 bail. They were detained as they wait to have their bond processed. The case will be heard on August 14. Gendia and Kandiege dormitories were torched early last week. Fifteen students from Ratanga Boys High in Ndhiwa were grilled over a fire in the school. The dorm went up in flames when students were watching a World Cup match. Homa Bay county police commander Marius Tum yesterday said the suspects were taken to Ndhiwa police station. Their parents were informed that they face charges. “Police are assessing burnt property, which will be used as evidence in court,” he said.
