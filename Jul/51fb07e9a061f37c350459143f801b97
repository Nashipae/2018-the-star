The prosecution is opposed to the release on bail of two police officers who are on trial for the killing of a businesswoman at City Park in Nairobi two months ago. Yesterday, senior state prosecutor Catherine Mwaniki told Justice Stella Mutuku they also oppose a bid by the two to cross-examine the investigating officer. On trial are Constable William Chirchir from Makadara police station and AP Godfrey Kirui from Industrial Area. The two officers have denied murdering Janet Wanja on May 20. They face a different charge at the magistrate court for the attempted murder of Bernard Chege. Wanja, 41, and Chege, 26, who is recuperating from gunshot wounds, are said to have parked at City Park in the morning hours when they were attacked. The prosecution said the officers fired 15 bullets into a vehicle the two were in. Chege has since claimed that his life is in danger following threats by unidentified people. This is one of the arguments Constable Lawrence Irungu has advanced in court to block the release of the two officers on bail. Yesterday, human rights group International Justice Mission was allowed to represent victims. Mutuku directed IJMâ€™s lawyer Edward Mbanya to be served with the application by the two immediately. The judge also pushed the hearing to Tuesday next week awaiting a pre-bail report. In their application, the two officers argue bail is a constitutional right.
