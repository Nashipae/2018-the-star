Read: CEO Chiloba suspended, IEBC in chaos Multiple sources say plans are underway to have positions left by Roselyn Akombe, Consolata Nkatha, Margaret Mwachanya and Paul Kurgat filled. This will ensure the commission has the capacity to manage upcoming  boundaries review.In April, IEBC vice-chairperson Nkatha and commissioners Mwachanya and  Kurgat resigned, citing lack of faith in Chebukati’s leadership. Akombe quit the commission immediately after the August 2017 General Election, saying the October26 repeat presidential election could not meet basic expectations of credibility and fairness.The JLAC chairman, William Cheptumo, yesterday said the reforms and the filling of the vacancies is a legal and political process that requires sufficient time.“As the committee we are aware of the concerns and the pressure from the public. We will scrutinise all proposals by all stakeholders,” Cheptumo said.Two weeks ago, the  embattled CEO  showed up at his Anniversary Towers office in Nairobi to find new locks.When he asked, Chiloba  was allegedly told Chebukati had “travelled abroad” with the office keys.The Employment and Labour Relations Court has allowed Chiloba to go back to work, pending the determination of an application against the compulsory leave he was forced to take by the chairman.Chebukati sent Chiloba on leave in March to pave way for investigations into the procurement of elections materials.
