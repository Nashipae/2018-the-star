Structures at Buruburu shopping centre and Mutindwa market were demolished on Thursday morning as part of ongoing operations by Nairobi county. Those at the shopping centre included hotels, pubs, stalls and a car wash. Traders at the market were given time to remove their goods from the structures before the operation began. "We learned earlier that they were coming so we woke up early to get our property," Tom Oluoch said. He and others said they had received eviction notices but did not expect to leave in a short while. Mutindwa had been restructured and a road constructed to link Buruburu estate to Outering Road. City Hall operations director  Peter Mbaya told the Star on phone that the operations were in order. "Mutindwa market traders did not resist because they knew it was to happen," he said. "Once we are done, people will appreciate the outcome."

Embakasi East politicians, however, condemned the move, MP Babu Owino saying: “The stalls were the main source of livelihood for the traders. Some took loans to open their businesses." Utawala MCA Patrick Karani said the demolitions will not strengthen security as the county government alleged.
