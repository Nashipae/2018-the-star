The Kenya Ports Authority has acquired a new Sh1.1 billion tugboat to boost efficiency. The tugboat, a 75 Bollard Pull (BP), is the first of its kind in East and Central Africa. It will be instrumental in undertaking marine operations including berthing and unberthing ships. It is the largest tug in a fleet of five. KPA general manager for engineering services Rashid Salim said the new tug will ensure smooth operations at the seaside especially when one of the tugs is out of station for maintenance and repair. Christened Eugene, Azimuth Stern Driven (ASD) tug arrived at the Port of Mombasa on Monday after a 26-day journey from the Cheoy Lee Shipbuilders in China.
