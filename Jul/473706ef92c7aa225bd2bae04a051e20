The new Gikomba Market will have 525 stalls occupying five floors and construction will begin in October, a proposal by City Hall shows. Deputy President William Ruto announced last Sunday the market would cost Sh3 billion. He spoke during a service at African Independent Pentecostal Church in Kayole, Nairobi. He said traders would have a better working environment and frequent fires will be a thing of the past. Sixteen people were killed in the latest fire at the market on June 28. At least 60 were injured. Ruto said small-scale traders will be prioritised in the Nairobi regeneration plan. City Hall and the national government agreed to find a permanent solution for perennial fires that spread quickly through makeshift structures.

A standoff looms, since the structures will be torn down to pave the way for the new market. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko said the design is complete. In a statement, he said the county government is seeking approvals from the National Environment Management Authority. Sonko said the tender for the market would be announced in mid August. He said the tender would be signed in September, and construction is expected to begin on October 1. The project will be completed in a year.
