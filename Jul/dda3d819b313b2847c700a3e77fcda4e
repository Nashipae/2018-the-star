Two Cuban doctors deployed to Murang’a will conduct five plastic surgeries on burns patients at the county referral hospital. The two doctors — a family health doctor and a plastic surgeon — reported on Saturday and have conducted one plastic surgery. Patients who have been admitted to the hospital have expressed optimism that the two specialists will help them recover better and faster. The plastic surgeon, Sergio Diaz, said he is ready to work with local medics. Governor Mwangi wa Iria, who received the doctors on Tuesday, lauded the national government for its efforts to streamline the health sector by bringing in the doctors. He said the medics will fill the gap in services and “inch the country closer towards achieving universal healthcare coverage”. The governor said the county did not have a plastic surgeon before and has only one family physician based at Maragua sub-district Hospital. “Patients who required the services of a plastic surgeon had to be referred to the national referral hospital or private facilities,” he said. Local medical practitioners, he noted, are ready to work together with the Cuban doctors and adopt the Cuban health system. The two, he added, will help the health department establish a more elaborate system that will make medical services accessible to all. He said the report he received from the national government indicated that the Cuban health care is more preventive than curative saying he is ready to adopt such an approach. Patients who cannot express themselves in English language will have an interpreter while consulting the doctors.
