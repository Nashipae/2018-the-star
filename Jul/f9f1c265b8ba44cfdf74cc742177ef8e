Kenya Breweries Limited has approved production of Senator Keg at Kisumu brewery. The first Senator Keg pint was test-tasted at the Kisumu Brewery by KBL top brass led by MD Jane Karuku on Tuesday. This marks a milestone for the Sh15 billion investment. The test-tasting was performed exactly a year and five days after the refurbishment of the brewery commissioned last July. “We have invested at least 900,000 man-hours to date. It marks a milestone that we’re truly proud of. We will be producing safe and quality alcohol,” Karuku said.
