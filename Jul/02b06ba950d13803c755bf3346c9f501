Senior counsel Billy Shigoli was on Friday arraigned at Milimani Law Courts over theft of Sh4,027,500 fromÂ his client. He allegedly received the cash between January 15 and March 7, 2017 as Caroline Cheledi's agent in a transaction. Shigoli did not take plea as his lawyer John Swaka pleaded for deferral on health grounds. Swaka said the accused was suffering emotionally, psychologically and physically, and was therefore unfit to take plea. He added that Shigoli is diabetic yet he has not had his injections since being taken to custody on Thursday afternoon. Swaka further said his client is asthmatic and that the cold cells worsened his condition so he needed to see his doctor. Senior principal magistrate Samuel Cheruiyot released Shigholi on a personal bond of Sh300,000 and set the plea-taking for August 9. Click here for the latest political stories
