Women leaders have condemned the rise in sexual assault against women living with disability. Fida chairperson Josephine Mong’are yesterday said the government should give security to women with disability and act accordingly for those affected. “I call upon county governments to prioritise the disabled persons and give them jobs to address their problems,” she said. Mong’are said giving disabled women government jobs will end complaints of being left out of state positions. Women with disability also said there is little action from the authorities to punish their attackers. On Sunday, a local TV station aired the story of a disabled Busia woman who was gang-raped and killed.
