A man in Gankere village, North Imenti on Sunday night hacked his wife to death. Poly Kathambi, 30, was brutally murdered by her husband Paul Nteere, 36, after a domestic dispute. Kathambi was ECDE  teacher at a neighbouring school. The suspect is being held at Meru town police station. "When we interrogated him at Nchiru police station, he alleged, he found her wife in his father's bed. But this is not true because I knew his father, It is false. Last year, the young man was mentally ill and I don't know if he sought medical attention," area Chief James Mutethia said. Last week Josphat Mwoga was poisoned at Miomponi in Tigania West, Meru. His brother John Mutirithia said they were taking alcoholic in an illicit brew den when he was poisoned. But OCPD Walter Obondo said they have arrested some suspects as investigations are ongoing.
