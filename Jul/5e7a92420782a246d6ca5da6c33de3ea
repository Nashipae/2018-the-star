Security officers in Ntimaru subcounty, Kuria, have recovered only three illegal guns during the one-month amnesty issued by the government. The deadline is July 24. Ntimaru assistant county commissioner Kelvin Lewa said two rifles stolen from a police officer from Kehancha police station were returned. Police also received a pistol from another resident. Community leaders and security officers are working to collect illegal firearms. A month ago Nyanza regional commissioner Moffat Kangi gave the Kuria region until July 24 to surrender illegal guns. It said that thereafter it would launch a crackdown and punish illegal arms holders. This came after rustlers from Kuria East shot dead two people in Ragana village, Suna West. Lewa said the community has also provided names of two people having illegal guns and has promised to have them surrendered before the deadline. “We’re still talking to the community to surrender the illegal firearms peacefully before the deadline,” he said. “These illegal guns have been behind widespread insecurity. We will ensure those with illegal guns are disarmed.” Lewa said bandits use the porous Kenya-Tanzanian border to bring smuggle in guns “These guns are used in most of the cattle rusting and killing in the region,” he said. On Friday, Wangirabose location chief Ayub Maga appealed to the community to comply with the directive “before the law catches up with you”. He said security is crucial for economic development. “In nearby Narok county where conflicts over cattle rustling have been high, 47 guns have been surrendered. We need the same in the Kuria region before we use force,” he said. Magaiwa said most illegal gun holders fear chiefs and their assistants and urged them to surrender them to nearby police stations. He spoke at a baraza in Ntimaru town. The government seeks to end banditry in the region. Lewa said they will mop up remaining firearms to ensure order.
