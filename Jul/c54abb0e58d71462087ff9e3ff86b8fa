Four governors in Nyanza will learn this month whether they retain their offices when the Court of Appeal rules in Kisumu. The victories of Governors Okoth Obado (Migori), John Nyangarama (Nyamira) and James Ongwae of Kisii were upheld at by the HighCourt. Their challengers appealed. Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti will know on July 19 whether he retains his seat. His election was nullified following a petition by former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwang’a. Awiti appealed. In Migori, former Rongo MP Ochilo Ayako has appealed the High Court’s decision to uphold Obado’s election. Through lawyers Roch Odhiambo and Nyamori Nyasimi, Ayako says he did not get a fair trial at the High Court. He says the judge struck out a section of his evidence, which greatly affected his case. Ayako said the judge also erred when he ignored alleged election offences committed by the governor. The Court of Appeal will rule on July 27. In Nyamira, former Kitutu Masaba MP Walter Nyambati wants the election of Governor Nyangarama nullified, saying the voting process was flawed. He blamed Justice James Makau, who dismissed his petition in the High Court. Nyambati said his decision was unfair and he did not consider all evidence submitted. In Kisii, Makori Onsando said High Court justice Hellen Omondi overlooked massive poll irregularities when she upheld Governor Ongwae’s election. Ongwae will know his futureon July 26. Through lawyers Peter Wanyama and Okong’o Omogeni, he termed the grounds laid by Makori as incompetent and asked that the case should be struck off.
