Jazz
lovers are in for a treat following confirmation that globally
acclaimed American jazz performers five-time Grammy winner Dianne Reeves and Marcus Miller will
be on the 2018-19 Season of Safaricom Jazz. The event is slated for October 18-20 at the Safaricom Jazz Lounge, which is one of the events that
lead up to the annual Safaricom International Jazz Festival in February. Reeves won the Best Jazz Vocal Grammy for the soundtrack in George Clooney’s six-time
Academy Award nominated “Good Night, and Good Luck”. “We
are honoured to be yet again hosting one of the most influential jazz
musicians in the world for the concert in October,” Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore said. Proceeds from all ticket sales will be donated to the Ghetto classics music programme, which has been the Safaricom Jazz beneficiary since 2014 and has so far received an estimated Sh60 million, funds that have benefitted over 1,400 children from Nairobi and Mombasa. Proceeds from the 2018-19 edition will see the Ghetto Classics Schools programme extend to Kisumu. The first edition of the Safaricom International Jazz Festival was held in February 2014 and was headlined by New York-based Cameroonian artiste Richard Bona.
