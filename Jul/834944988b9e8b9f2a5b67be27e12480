Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu yesterday rejected claims he is sought by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission over misuse of funds. He said he had not been summoned by the Director of Criminal Investigations, but would be obliged by its directive. Social media had been awash with claims the county boss was being hunted by the EACC. "Nobody is looking for me. I’m only seeing the information on social media. If called, I’m very ready to honour the summons so I can clear my name," Waititu said. He accused his critics of “creating the lies” to malign him ahead of the 2022 election. Waititu also dismissed social media reports he had given Sh500 million tenders to his family members.
