Former Transport CS Michael Kamau has failed to take plea for the second time before an anti-corruption court, where he faces charges of abuse of office. He wants his appeal determined at the Supreme Court. “I plead with the anti-corruption court to stop my criminal proceedings until the Supreme Court hears and determines my appeal,” he said through lawyer James Orengo. The former CS is fighting to have the case before the anti-corruption court quashed.

However the prosecution, through state counsel, opposed his application saying the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal and that the prosecution was allowed to continue with the case. The court will give the ruling on July 6. More: EACC raids ex-CS Michael Kamau's home over Sh33 million tender Click here for the latest political news
