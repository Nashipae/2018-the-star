Tea farmers in Murang’a have urged the state to help them get better pay. The farmers said they struggle with poor prices and low returns, despite tea being a leading foreign exchange earner. Kiru Tea Factory chairman Geoffrey Chege attended a farmers’ meeting in Murang’a on Monday. He said they have been abandoned by the state and left at the mercy of cartels and brokers. Chege said the government must stop individuals enriching themselves with tea proceeds at the expense of hardworking farmers. He said 75 per cent of tea proceeds end up in cartels’ pockets. “It’s unfortunate that most tea farmers remain poor for years because of the cartels,” Chege said. He said some corrupt individuals who don’t own a single tea bush are the biggest beneficiaries of the farmers’ hard work. The chairman called on the National Assembly and the Senate to come up with laws to cushion farmers from exploitation. Chege added that unscrupulous individuals behind illegal tea deals have wreaked havoc on the industry. “It’s the mandate of our lawmakers and senators to ensure policies favour and protect farmers. A solution to the problems facing the sector must be sought once and for all,” he said. “Farmers must be included because they better understand the problems they face.”
