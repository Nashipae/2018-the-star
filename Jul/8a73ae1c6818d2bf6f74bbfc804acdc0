AAR has introduced a monthly payments option for health covers to ease the financial burden. The option is, however, only open to individuals, not corporate clients. One will be required to pay a deposit equivalent to two months instalments then make subsequent payments monthly for nine months. “The solution we are introducing fits well into the financial plan of many ordinary Kenyans,” managing director Nixon Shigoli said. According to a September 2017 report by the Insurance Regulatory Authority, penetration currently stands at 2.73 per cent. The figure dipped from 2.8 per cent in 2016. However an audit of the sector by KPMG estimates penetration to be 3 per cent.
