Thugs shot dead a student of Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology on Tuesday night at Thathiini village. The thugs were stealing from students who have rented at the market, about two kilometres from the colege. They shot Rodgers Mengo (pictured) when he resisted and stole his phone and laptop. Grace Wanjiku, Mengo’s neighbour, said the gang broke their wooden doors using a large stone. “They were demanding Sh10,000 from me, which I didn’t have. I gave them only Sh500 which I had. They left and after a while I heard my neighbour calling me ‘Grace, help me I am dying’.” He was rushed to Kiambu Level Five Hospital, where he died.
