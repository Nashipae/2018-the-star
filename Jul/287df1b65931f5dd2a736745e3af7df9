Elders in Garissa have urged Kenyans to respect the President. They took issue with remarks by elders in the Rift Valley who asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare his stand on the 2022 election. Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey read a statement on behalf of the elders in Garissa town on Friday. On Wednesday, some elders from the Rift Valley said Uhuru’s silence on whether or not he would support Deputy President William Ruto to succeed him was sending mixed signals. They spoke in Nakuru town. They asked the President to explain what the March 9 handshake with Opposition leader Raila Odinga entailed to end speculation. But their colleagues in Garissa said the elders should have sought audience with the President instead of issuing press statements. “They appear to be making threats, and we can’t accept that. The top seat is not a reserve for a few tribes,” the Garissa elders said. “We are surprised by their utterances. Elders should be in forefront building bridges. They should help cement the handshake by championing peace and unity. We need to move forward.”
