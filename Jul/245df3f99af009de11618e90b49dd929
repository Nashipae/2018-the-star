Mombasa was  relatively peaceful during the electioneering period last year because of a well-coordinated plan between the state and the civil society, a forum was told on Tuesday.
The county had been identified as a potential violence hotspot in the run-up to the August 8 General Election.
Administrators, security officers, civil society and religious leaders said they worked behind the scenes to prevent chaos.
“Peace committees formed in the six subcounties were effective. We shared information. Issues were addressed swiftly,” Feisal Bahero, a representative of the District Peace Committee, said.
County commissioner Evans Achoki said coordination between the government, and non-state actors was key. This had been missing in previous elections, he said.
They spoke during the Mombasa County Dialogue Forum organised by Act! and Muslims for Human Rights (Muhuri). The conference took stock of the election. Participants discussed security problems and divisive politics.
Muhuri rapid response officer Frederick Okado said it was the first time the state was willing to work with civil society organisations to bring peace.
“We had programmes supported by the state. The youth aired their views, which were addressed by the state,” Okado said.
Mombasa Devolution executive Seth Odongo said Governor Hassan Joho ensured all communities were involved in county leadership.
He said unemployment is a major cause of insecurity. Youth were given contracts to clean Mombasa.
