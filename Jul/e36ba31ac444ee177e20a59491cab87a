Four school fires were reported on Tuesday night, bringing to 22 the number of learning institutions that have been affected in the last 11 days. All the cases involved dormitories, where nothing was salvaged, and there were no casualties. At Kisii High School, Wire House dormitory went up in flames from about 8 pm as students attended evening preps. The county team put out the fire.

Via Twitter, Red Cross Communications Manager Noellah Musundi said: “Busy night for [Red Cross] emergency responders as another school fire is reported at Dr Aloo Gumbe Secondary School in Kisumu." The aid agency reported another incident at Makhokho Secondary in Kakamega. The spate of fires prompted top Education officials to tour the most affected regions on Tuesday. Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang went to Shimo La Tewa Secondary School in Mombasa while Cabinet Secretary Mohamed Amina went to Kisumu Girls' High school. Kipsang warned students that they will not hide behind uniforms and commit crimes. "We shall unmask them and treat them as criminals," he said. The CS reiterated the warning and confirmed that 22 students had been arrested in Kisumu by Tuesday over cases of arson and destruction of property. “Three are in remand while two are out on bond,” she said, adding the investigations were at different stages. Knec chairman George Magoha, who accompanied the CS, said candidates will write KCSE examinations under trees if students continue to burn schools. This was in response to claims that some of the cases were due to exam jitters. The cases are reminiscent of the scenario in 2016 when fires razed buildings at more than 450 schools.
