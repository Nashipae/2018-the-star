Two dormitories have been razed at Nguviu Boys’ High School over alleged long night studying hours and principal transfer. More than 200 students at one of the best schools in Embu were left without somewhere to sleep after their dormitories were torched by their colleagues. Three Form Two students were arrested and charged with arson. Embu North acting police boss John Muisyo said principal Nicolas Mutisya reported that the buildings caught fire at 9.20pm as students were in class. Embu firefighters rushed to the scene but none of the students’ belongings was salvaged. The buildings’ roofs caved in and students’ belongings were reduced to ashes. Muisyo said the police are  investigating the fires before taking further action. Parents went to the school but were denied entrance as education officials were assessing the buildings  accompanied by area MP John Muchiri. Wananchi who went to help put out the fire said the students were heard complaining of long study hours at night. They said the students also complained about the transfer of their principal at the beginning of the year. County director of Education Margaret Mwirigi said the cause of the fire was being investigated before a decision could be made on whether to send the students home. This is the first school fire to be experienced in Embu.  Since January 1 at least 46 schools have  be hit by arson and riots in many parts of the country. About 125 students have arrested in the past three weeks and the number is rising. The government last week announced it will not pay for damage at schools following the cases of student unrest and burning of dorms.
