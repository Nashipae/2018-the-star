Coast regional coordinator Bernard Leparmarai (pictured) has warned junior police officers against harassing residents. He said police should establish a good working relationship with the community if they want peace and stability. “You cannot harass people, claiming it is in line of duty. Police work is not to extort money or beat up people but to ensure safety and stability of Kenyans,” Leparmarai said. He spoke during a peace forum in Kinondo. Leparmarai called for a new community policing team to enhance a good relationship between the community and police to tackle insecurity in Kwale county. He urged residents to be patient and follow procedures if police violate the law. “You can give a thief two slaps but then take him to the nearest police station for them to carry out their function. Do not take the law into your hands,” he told Kinondo residents. A police officer was recently lynched in the area over alleged theft.  Cases of insecurity at Kwale, especially in Ukunda, are on the rise. Click here for the latest political news
