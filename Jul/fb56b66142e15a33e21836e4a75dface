Nine suspects in the Solai Dam tragedy were yesterday ordered released on Sh5 million bond or Sh2.5 million bail each. The suspects, who included billionaire Perry Mansukh, the owner of Patel Dam, had spent three nights in remand. Others are Vinoj Kumar, Johnson Njuguna, Williec Omondi, Lynette Cheruiyot, Winnie Muthoni, Jacinta Were, Tomkin Odhiambo and Luka Kipyegen. Naivasha principal magistrate Joseph Karanja directed them to hand over their travel documents to the court and report to the office of the DCIO in Nakuru every fortnight. Julius Kavita, a senior government officer who had been initially charged with 48 counts of manslaughter, was discharged and replaced by Kipyegen. Kavita is Rongai deputy county commissioner. He was in charge when the tragedy occurred, while Kipyegen is the current Rongai subcounty administrator. The pretrial will be on August 3.
