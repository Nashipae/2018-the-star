Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has lost some of his most trusted lieutenants. They include Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and her Jomvu counterpart Badi Twalib who have been warming up to Deputy President William Ruto. Joho has shown interest in the top seat in 2022, so has the DP. On Tuesday, Muslim clerics in Mombasa dealt the governor’s State House ambitions a huge blow when they supported those leaning towards Ruto’s camp. "We support any leader who backs either President Uhuru Kenyatta or Deputy President William Ruto to give us development," Kenya Muslims National Advisory Council said at a Mombasa hotel. Chairman Sheikh Juma Ngao said for Joho to earn their support, he must first unite all the MPs, governors and ward representatives in the Coast region. As events unfold, Joho said he should not be underated. “I will surprise many people,” he said during the Eid Baraza on June 17. His aide Mohamed Hatimy told the Star yesterday, the governor was busy working.
