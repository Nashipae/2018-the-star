The 2018 London Marathon champions —Eliud Kipchoge and Vivian Cheruiyot—are determined to re-write their personal bests this year. Kipchoge said his push to lower his marathon running time begins in September during the Berlin Marathon. “I may not smash the world record but I am preparing to run my personal best in Berlin,” Kipchoge said in Kabarak on Saturday. He and Vivian were the 2018 ambassadors of the second Kabarak University Equator run. “I have enjoyed the season from last year and I hope to make it even better,” said Kipchoge. He timed 2:04:17 to win his third London Marathon in April, having taken a break from the race last year to try to run a sub-two-hour marathon in Italy. Kipchoge returned to add to his 2015 and 2016 titles with ease, finishing ahead of Ethiopia’s Tola Shura Kitata in two minutes 20 seconds off Dennis Kimmetto’s world record. In the same London race, Vivian, 34, crossed the finish line in a personal best of 2:18:3, three minutes off the 2:15:25 ran by four-time British Olympian Radcliffe ran in 2003. Vivian said she hopes to run at least one marathon before end of the year. “ I will run a marathon before end of the year but I don’t know which one,” Vivian said. Meanwhile, Abraham Kiptum and Valery Jemeli won the second edition of Kabarak University Half Marathon in a race runners cross from the equator, from the Northern hemisphere to finish in the Southern hemisphere. Kiptum, who is also the Daegu Marathon winner, clocked 62.02 ahead of Stephen Kiprop (63.38) and Gideon Kipketer (63.51) while Jemeli, a former Kass Marathon winner, won the race in 73:20, beating Celestine Chepchirchir (73:48) and Joy Kamuma ( 74:30) top second and third places respectively.
