44th US
President Barack Obama arrives in Kenya tomorrow. He is here as the
guest of honour at the launch of the Sauti Kuu centre in Kogalo set up
by the foundation of his sister Auma Obama. Firstly, Karibu
Sana. Obama will always be more popular in Kenya than Donald Trump or
any other American president. He is seen as Kenyan as much as he is
American. Secondly we should commend his sister and the Sauti Kuu Foundation for setting up this vocational centre. Kenya used to have vocational training colleges but most of them were mistakenly converted into universities. As
a result, today in Nairobi it is difficult and expensive to find a
plumber while graduates in law and media are unable to get jobs. Kenya urgently needs to start training many more plumbers, masons, carpenters and blue collar workers. Obama
has done well to come here to bless the new Sauti Kuu training centre.
Hopefully it will be followed by many other training centres to help
young people to find employment.  Quote of the day: "This land is your land, this land is my land... This land was made for you and me."  Woody Guthrie American singer-songwriter was born on 14 July, 1912
