Kitui MCAs have rejected Sh150 million allocation proposed by the executive for a livestock upgrade programme. Governor Charity Ngilu’s administration had said the cash would be spent on breed improvement to increase returns for farmers and traders. Instead, the assembly reassigned the money and increased it by Sh50 million to build 20 dams of about 60,000 cubic metres for Sh10 million each. The decision by the Budget and Appropriations committee  chaired by Boniface Kasina (Tseikuru) has technically collapsed the Livestock Resources Management and Development programme. Yesterday, Kasina said his committee ignored the project because  it had not been captured in the County Fiscal Strategy Paper and the Annual Development Plan, which influence budgetting and highlight priorities. The programme was to be undertaken in partnership with the South Eastern Kenya University (Seku). Ngilu and Seku  VC Geoffrey Muluvi signed a deal on June 18 to implement it. Ngilu said her administration was committed to projects that create jobs and improve residents’ income and livelihoods. She said tapping into the expertise, technology and knowledge at Seku would help solve the county’s problems. Another proposal by the county executive to set aside Sh25 million for the setting up a university was removed  from the budget. “It is the feeling of the committee that this is not a devolved function,” the MCAs said in their report. According to the Constitution, universities are under the national government — alongside primary and secondary schools. The counties are only tasked with managing early childhood development and education centres.
