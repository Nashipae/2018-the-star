ODM leader Raila Odinga has said the Big Four agenda was not part of his discussions with President Uhuru Kenyatta ahead of the famed March 9 handshake. Speaking during the burial of Migori Senator Ben Oluoch on Monday, Raila said they were ready to negotiate everything and that this was why he decided to meet Uhuru alone. "We somehow agreed that we had to meet and we were only prepared to talk if we could bring the other topics to the table, not the Big Four agenda," he said. "We agreed that [if] we met others, there would be vested interests," he added. Raila explained that the handshake was key to the country's achievement of electoral justice and that this remains his focus in the Building Bridges Initiative. Uhuru has identified manufacturing, universal healthcare, food security and provision of 500, 000 affordable housing units as his key agendas during his last term. Food security and healthcare, which fall under agriculture and health respectively, are devolved functions on which the Jubilee administration, Nasa and its governors must agree for smooth implementation. Before the handshake between the two leaders, the Big Four agenda faced opposition from Raila's stronghold. Before that, National Super Alliance leaders and governors in the opposition had vowed not to recognise Uhuru's presidency after Raila withdrew from the race. Uhuru wants to use the Big Four to shape his legacy as he prepares to leave office in 2022.
