Companies interested in power generation and distribution will be licensed to improve supply and connectivity. Energy Regulatory Commission director general Pavel Oimeke yesterday rejected claims the Kenya Power enjoys monopoly of distribution. He said the commission has licensed 10 operators to generate power for consumers. “Any investor who wishes to generate and sell power to consumers or purchase from the generators and distribute will be licensed according to the law,” Oimeke said. He said also dismissed media reports that they were planning to increase power tariffs. He said the claims were baseless. Electricity costs will reduce from this month based on the new tariffs, Oimeka said. He was answering questions from members of the public regarding new tariffs. The forum was held at a Garissa hotel. Oimeke said it has always been the wish of the ERC to have Kenyans pay less. He said the cost will be reduced to benefit many low-income earners who spend between 1-15 units a month. The ERC will also harmonise the rates paid per unit and lower fixed charges so the cost does not change based on the unit purchased. According to a media report, the ERC had proposed that middle-class homes that consume 50kWh would pay Sh1,247 up from Sh691. It said consumers of 200 units would pay Sh4,988 up from Sh4,106. These are charges loaded on power bills that include 16 per cent VAT, fuel and forex levies for June. KP Mungai, who is in charge of business strategy at the KPLC, said the company has put in place a new customers service system and improved meter reading to end outrageous power bills that have caused an uproar among Kenyans. “We’ve now improved our meter reading to 98 per cent. Every consumer will be getting accurate bills and not estimates. The issue of errant bills will be a thing of the past,” he said. The ERC will also organise public-participation forums in Mombasa, Eldoret, Kisumu, Naivasha and Nairobi. It seeks to educate people on the new tariffs.
