The government will be required to spend Sh1.5 billion on the 2020 IAAF World Under-20 Championship after winning the bid to host the prestigious event. Sports Cabinet secretary, Rashid Echesa, made the announcement after the world governing body, IAAF, awarded Kenya the hosting rights in Buenos Aires on Thursday. Kenya hosted the World Under-17 Championships last year which turned out to be a roaring success with the Moi International Sports Centre (MISC), Kasarani, sold out. Echesa said a committee for the event will be set up next month to oversee the preparations for the junior show. He said the government is delighted to have been granted the rights to host the event and assured of a world class event. “It will be remembered that Nairobi hosted a very successful World Under-18 Championships and it is in this light that Kenya’s bid to host a world event was honoured once again,” noted Echesa. He added: “We have the facilities and will continue to prepare to ensure we have the venue and other facilities ready for the World Under 20 event as well as prepare a team for the championships.” Echesa said the event will be hosted at Kasarani and assured IAAF that everything to do with the sports infrastructures in the country is on course. “I take this opportunity to assure IAAF that Kenya has been working on its sports infrastructure across the country. Kasarani in particular has been under renovation for several months and will therefore be ready to host this global event,” he added. Kenya recently topped the World Under-20 Championship in Tampere, Finland, where the nation bagged six gold, four silver and a bronze medal. Echesa said he is confident the athletics talent in the country can dominate the event on home soil.
