Homa Bay governor Cyprian Awiti has announced that he will move to the Supreme Court to challenge the annulment of his election. The county boss said this on Saturday in regard to the Appeals court's decision to uphold the High court judgement on the matter. "After consultation with my party leader, I am proceeding to the Supreme Court to challenge the decision of the Court of Appeal on Homa Bay governor election," he said on his official Facebook page. The High court, following a petition which was filed by Oyugi Magwanga - former Kasipul MP, said the August 2017 vote in Homa Bay was marred with irregularities. Awiti moved to the appellate court to challenge the decision and the same was dismissed for lack of merit in a ruling read by Justice Fatuma Sichale on Thursday.

decision by Judge Joseph Karanja who said the IEBC failed to ensure
a free and fair election. The appeal was dismissed with a Sh5 million cost down from Sh6 million setting the stage for a fresh election to fill the governor seat. Magwanga commended the court for the decisive ruling saying the will of the people was obeyed. He said the court had served justice for Homa Bay people and challenged Awiti to face him on the ballot. "I want to tell my opponent that if he is man enough then let us meets on the ballot. The electorates will decide," Magwanga said. With the latest development, Awiti still has a chance to continue discharging his duties as governor until the apex court decides the matter. Click here for the latest political news
