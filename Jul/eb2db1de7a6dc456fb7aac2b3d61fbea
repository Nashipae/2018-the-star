President Uhuru Kenyatta has called Jubilee MPs to a meeting tomorrow. Although government officials say the meeting will discuss only the Big Four and the role of MPs in ensuring their success, it is important that the President addresses the emerging issues within his party. The rift between him and Deputy President William Ruto seems to be growing by the day, with Ruto allies openly accusing the people around the President of fighting Ruto’s 2022 bid. Further, Ruto continues to indirectly but consistently campaign across the country under the guise of assisting the President and inspecting development. While being Jubilee’s 2022 point man could place Ruto in an advantageous position to succeed President Kenyatta, his early campaigns could work against him. They could also affect President Kenyatta’s push for the Big Four he wants to deliver as his legacy. With some Central Kenya politicians and elders expressing dismay with Ruto’s tours, the infighting could also hurt the President's Building Bridges initiative supported by Opposition leader Raila Odinga. As President Kenyatta meets his MPs, it is important he makes clear that he is focussed on realising his legacy projects and fighting against corruption.
