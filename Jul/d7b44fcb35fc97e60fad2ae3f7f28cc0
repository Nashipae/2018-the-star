Trans Nzoia assembly speaker Joshua Werunga and youth leaders want MCAs to support completion of the county referral hospital. The MCAs allocated Sh200 million instead of the Sh330 million requested by the executive. On Monday, Werunga said Sh800 million has been invested in the facility and it must be completed. "We can’t leave it unfinished. It’ll serve generations in more than 200 years to come," he said in Kitale, urging elected leaders to support it. The youth warned those frustrating the project to stop. Led by Bruce Cheti, they said the facility is one of Governor Patrick Khaemba’s signature projects and must be completed before his final term ends.
