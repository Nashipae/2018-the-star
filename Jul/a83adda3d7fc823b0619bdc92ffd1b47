Residents who own land along the proposed Sh6 billion Eldoret Southern Bypass project are still waiting for compensation six years later. Ngeria resident Paul Maiyo said the National Land Commission gave landowners compensation letters. Residents have threatened to hold demonstrations, saying they are being taken for a ride. They spoke to the media yesterday. Contractors have placed beacons on our land yet the Kenya National Highways Authorities has not discussed the cost of the property, they said. Maiyo  said the value of land has increased since 2012. He said   it seems  the  government has  forgotten  about them and leaders are more focused on politics. Another resident Paul Lagat said they cannot cultivate their land. He said they are farmers who depend on the land for their livelihood. “Some  of our children are at home for lack of school fees,” he said.
