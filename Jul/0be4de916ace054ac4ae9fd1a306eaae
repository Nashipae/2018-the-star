Early childhood development and education teachers will be required to hold diplomas once a draft policy comes into force. A draft framework to guide the scheme of service in the sector states that the teachers will have to undergo two-and-a-half-year training, while assistant teachers will be required to have certificate qualification. The scheme was developed by the Council of Governors, the Teachers Service Commission, the Ministry of Education and the Salaries and Renumeration Commission in conjunction with Unicef. Upon employment, the teachers will have a chance to move up the promotion ladder in six grades. The scheme also allows bachelor degree holders to compete for administrative roles currently reserved for P1 teachers. The framework has yet to be launched as the sector players await the approval of the ECDE Bill of 2014. On Thursday, Council of Governors education committee chairman Paul Chepkwony (Kericho) said the main problem hampering proper facilitation of ECDE education is inadequate funding from the Exchequer. “The CoG is lobbying for more funds from the national government to support the sector. It has not been the most successful sector in the country because it is highly underfunded,” he said. Chepkwony spoke during a joint meeting of ECDE teachers, the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development and other players. He said the scheme seeks to harmonise salaries to reduce pay disparityies among the counties. Education CS Amina Mohamed said the government is finalising quality standard guidelines, the national pre-primary education policy, the national competence-based assessment tool and review of teacher education curriculum. Kenya Publishers’ Association chairman Lawrence Njagi raised concerns over misleading teaching materials for ECDE. He said unapproved materials hurt education quality. He cited charts with wrong sounds mismatched with letters.
