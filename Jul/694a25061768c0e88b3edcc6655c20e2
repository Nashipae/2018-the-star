The High Court has ordered the Music Copyright Society of Kenya to account for the money it has collected as royalties and licence fees since January 1 last year. The society’s licence expired last year and the Kenya Copyright Board declined to renew it. On Friday, justices R N Sitati, DS Majanja and TW Cherere gave the MCSK 30 days to comply. “The accounts shall be delivered to the Kenya Copyright Board, which shall be at liberty to issue any further orders and directions,” they said. “There is evidence that the MCSK was collecting royalties, despite the fact that its licence had expired.” The judges said the copyright board is free to call for new applications for collection. They ruled in a case in which three petitions were merged and the Chief Justice directed that they be heard by a three-judge bench. The petitions were filed by Laban Toto Juma, David Amunga, Kisumu Bar Owners Association, Kisumu Green Garden Restaurant and Kennedy Moses Amakoye. Those listed as respondents included the Kenya Copyright Board, the Attorney General, the Music Copyright Society of Kenya and Music Publishers’ Association of Kenya. The judges nullified the one-year licence issued to the Music Publishers’ Association of Kenya to operate as a collective management organisation. It said no public input was considered. They did not, however, raise any issue with the 2018 licence issued to the association — meaning it will continue collecting royalties on behalf of creatives. “We have found that Section 46 of the Copyright Act is not unconstitutional and does not violate the right to property protected under Article 40 of the Constitution or the freedom of association protected by Article 36( 1-2 ) of the Constitution,” the bench said. Kenya Copyright Board executive director Edward Sigei said they will draft regulations in line with the expected new law. “The regulations will provide for timelines and public participation as suggested by the panel,” he said.
