Makueni residents have lashed out at the county emergency department for failing to find the body of a boy, 19, who drowned in a dam in Kaiti on Sunday. The Form 3 student from Makongo Secondary School died in Kwa Kiluva Dam as he swam with a classmate. The department and Kenya Red Cross officers called in divers from Kiambu, who retrieved the body on Monday evening. The body was taken to Makueni Level 4 Hospital mortuary. Residents and leaders said it was wrong to hire divers. Kaiti MP Joshua Kimilu questioned the county’s preparedness to deal with emergencies. “It is disturbing that our county seems to lack professional divers who can be called to save lives even before death occurs. Having to hire such services every time there is an emergency will continue to cost us lives,” the lawmaker said. Kimilu urged the county to partner with Red Cross to train divers. Devolution executive Julius Kaloi said they will fence all dams as a stopgap measure before developing a county rescue team.
