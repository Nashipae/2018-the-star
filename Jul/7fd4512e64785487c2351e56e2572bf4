Mombasa governor Hassan Joho's bid to beautify the city has suffered a blow after the high court suspended the repainting of buildings. Joho through his transport and infrastructure department had ordered all buildings in the CBD be painted white and blue. But on Thursday, judge Erick Ogola issued interim orders stopping the county from continuing with their mission. Ogola issued the orders after the county failed to reply to a petition filed by a beauty and cosmetic shop. On July 4, in an application filed by a cosmetic and beauty shop Best lady, said orders by the county was contrary to their brand colours. Through their lawyer Samuel Kariuki, the cosmetic shop said they had branches across the country with a similar colour and the Mombasa shop was not exempted.

They further argued that the county had started effecting their threats to prosecute persons who fail to comply with the directives. They noted the orders were unreasonable which restricts and limits the fundamental rights of the Best lady shop. Kariuki said his clients are bound to lose customers and revenue if they go ahead and change their trademark. He said the county boss erred in making such a declaration as he lacked authority to issue such directives. Click here for the latest political news
