Lamu governor Fahim Twaha has urged the Boni Forest community to take up modern farming to end poverty. He distributed 3,300 bags of fertiliser worth Sh4.9 million to 5,000 farmers yesterday. He said the national government is looking to improve agricultural techniques to ensure food security. The Boni community are traditional hunters and gatherers who depend on the forest for survival. They live on wild fruits, roots and honey. Twaha said times have changed and there is need for the community to consider farming to increase their food supply. He said the county government will work with the community to ensure a smooth transition to farming. “Food security is not a request, but an expectation. We understand and respect their way of life, but we know they would do better with a steady food supply,” the governor said. Twaha said the county government will help farmers so the county can meet its objective to become the Coast’s breadbasket. Farmers have already received seedlings. The governor said the county will buy 10 more tractors to improve farm preparation. Twaha said the county is putting up silos and granaries at Mvundeni in Lamu West to store cereal. “The essence is to be able to store cereals well so that they come in handy when need be and still be in perfect condition,” he said. In August last year, herders asked to move from Lamu to make way for the bombing of Boni Forest pitched camp at the Kipini border of Lamu and Tana River counties. Fear spread in the area after Operation Linda Boni director Joseph Kanyiri warned that they may be militants masquerading as herders. On August 18, Kanyiri asked all herders to take their animals away from the forest to allow bombings to flush out the terrorists.
