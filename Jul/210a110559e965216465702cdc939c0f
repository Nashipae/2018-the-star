Former Transport Cabinet Secretary Michael Kamau has been ordered to pay a cash bail of Sh 500,000 after he finally pleaded not guilty to charges of abuse of office. Kamau was further directed to present himself before the EACC for processing. Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti earlier ruled that Kamau should face trial dismissing an application he had filed at the Supreme Court seeking to halt the trial. Kamau faces two counts of abuse office and wilful failure to comply with applicable procedures as well as guidelines relating to the management of public funds. He was also accused of failing to comply with the set rules by ignoring the design of Kamukuywa-Kaptama-Kapsokwony-Sirisia Road done by Engiconsult Limited at a cost of Sh33,303,600 and entering into a memorandum under which the resident engineer redesigned the same road without due process. On Tuesday, Kamau failed to take a plea for the second time before the anti-corruption court seeking to have his appeal determined at the Supreme Court. "I plead with the anti-corruption court to stop my criminal proceedings until the Supreme Court hears and determines my appeal," he said through lawyer James Orengo. Trial magistrate Douglas Ogot was told that Kamau filed an appeal before the Supreme Court and that the application was certified as urgent. “It is our prayer that this plea be deferred to another date pending hearing and determination of the application before the Supreme Court,” submitted lawyer Orengo.
