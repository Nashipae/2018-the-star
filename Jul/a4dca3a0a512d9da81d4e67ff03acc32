A fire destroyed a dormitory at St Mary's Mumias Girls' High School on Monday morning. A teacher at the school told the Star on phone that it broke out while students were on assembly so there were no casualties. From the dormitory with a capacity of 100, it spread to a food store. Teachers at the school suspect an electrical fault caused the fire. Emergency response officers who went to the school said they would give updates. The school is expecting a new principal as the office holder was transferred under the Education ministry's delocalisation programme. Fires have been reported at several schools in Nairobi and other counties in the last few weeks. In the past, these incidents have resulted from student unrest and have caused so much concern that the Education ministry and other officials have ordered investigations.
