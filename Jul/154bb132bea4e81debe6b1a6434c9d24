Kuria residents in Migori county have surrendered five illegal guns ahead of an August 3 amnesty given by the government. Two AK47 rifles, a Ceska pistol, a home-made gun, and several rounds of ammunition were surrendered. Migori county commissioner Joseph Rotich asked residents to surrender more guns ahead of the deadline before the forceful disarmament begins. Rotich said the government estimates that over 200 illegal guns are in the area, weapons which are blamed for the runaway insecurity in the region. Kuria is one of the areas with rampant cases of cattle rustling, border disputes, and proliferation of guns through the porous Tanzania border. Rotich said the government will give direction on the next action upon the elapse of the amnesty period, but did not rule out the use of force. "We will not take any action against locals who voluntary surrender the guns to the police, chiefs' homes or any other places that can be reached by the government." Last week, Nyanza regional coordinator Moffat Kangi warned locals that the government may take decisive action to repossess guns held illegally. He said this in remarks to county security stakeholders during a meeting at Kehancha in Kuria West sub-county. In nearby Narok county, at least 47 guns were handed to the police.
