Property of unknown value was this morning destroyed after a school dormitory caught fire at Nduluku boys in Mbooni, Makueni. No student was injured in the 3 am incident. The School Principal Ambrose Ngesa told the Star that the dormitory hosted 36 students. He said about 26 mattresses, the student's school boxes and other personal effects were razed down. According to Mbooni East OCPD Agnes Amajong, preliminary investigations showed it was an act of arson. "When we visited the scene this morning, we found another dormitory sprinkled with petrol. This has something to do with arson," Amajong said. She said this is the fourth school in the county to gown down in flames in two months. Others that have reported same incidences include Kyemundu Secondary in Makueni Sub County, Good Shepherd and Kikuumini Secondary schools both in Kibwezi west sub-county.
