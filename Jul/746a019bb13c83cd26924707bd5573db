Opponents of a tax
on the use of social media in Uganda protested in the capital, Kampala, on Wednesday. The tax, introduced
at the beginning of the month, requires people to pay Ush200 [$0.05, Â£0.04] before they can use services like Facebook,
Twitter and WhatsApp. Today's demonstration was led by MP and popular musician Robert Kyagulanyi, who is better
known as Bobi Wine. The MP, a fierce critic of President Yoweri Museveni, posted videos on his Twitter account. Those in the protest
said the tax is killing youth innovation and entrepreneurship. Museveni has defended the tax, saying that social media is used to
spread gossip which he described as "opinions, prejudices,
insults [and] friendly chats". Read: 'Social media used to squander Uganda's money': Museveni defends tax Also read: Amnesty critical after Uganda levies unpopular social media tax Click here for the latest political news
