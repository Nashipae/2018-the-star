MPs have criticised governors for demanding immunity from prosecution. Only a serving president enjoys immunity. On Monday, the Council of Governors said county bosses should not be prosecuted while still in office. Led by Senate Minority Whip Mutula Kilonzo Jnr, lawmakers who addressed separate press conferences asked the governors to respect the Constitution and bear individual responsibility when linked to corruption. Kilonzo told the Council of Governors chaired by Turkana's Josphat Nanok to table their demand for immunity in Parliament. Nanok issued the immunity demand following the arrest and charging of their Busia governor Sospeter Ojaamong. “The best practice in jurisdictions that are devolved is that the heads of both levels of government have immunity on civil and criminal proceedings while they are in office,” Nanok said. If governors are prosecuted and imprisoned, their deputies assume office for the remainder of their terms, Mutula said. “The Constitution only allows for one President at a time and we have one now. These governors are just CEOs of the counties and should be subjected to the rule of law,” Mutula said. “As far as the law is concerned, governors have never attained the status similar to that of the President”. Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi said it was wrong for governors to use the council to shield themselves from criminal and civil prosecution. He asked the council to support the war on corruption.
