Bungoma Health executive Anthony Walela has accused some procurement officers of overstepping their mandate by pre-qualifying companies that offer exaggerated prices of commodities. He said many companies that are not pre-qualified lose tenders, despite offering affordable prices. "Most of the procurement officers are employed on permanent and pensionable terms, which makes it hard to instil discipline through dismissal," Walela said on Saturday while receiving a donation of medical supplies and equipment from Zakat Foundation of America. But yesterday county head of procurement Jeremiah Mushembi denied the allegations, saying his officers adhere to procurement laws.
