Police in Kericho have launched a manhunt for killers who struck at a homestead and killed a couple in the wee hours of Saturday. Kericho police commander James Mugera said Wesley Cheruiyot and his wife Evelyn were accosted by unknown people in their house at Chesingoro village in Bureti sub-county and bludgeoned to death with blunt objects. The assailants gained access to the house through the window. Sang was a teacher at Cheborge Secondary school. Speaking to the Star, Mugera said the bodies were taken to Kapkatet hospital mortuary for postmortem. He said it is ironic that visitors who were sleeping in adjustment rooms did not hear any commotion as their hosts were killed in cold blood. The couple's last born son escaped the horrific murder since he was in a different room. Two other children, one in University and another in secondary school, were not at home when their father and mother were attacked. Police are yet to identify the motive of the murder.
