MKU Vice Chancellor Stanley Waudo has taken a swipe at universities that complain over lack of funds for research. He told journalists on Thursday that it is the institutions that don't work hard to secure money for their projects. Waudo made the remarks in a briefing on the preparation for the 5th International and Interdisciplinary Research Conference, 2018 (5iiRC2018). Prof Waudo said that varsities and scholars who take time writing research proposals have no challenge of getting funds. "You can't wait for research funding yet you are not writing proposals and applying for resources to help you in your finding," the MKU VC said. He said some researchers are not keen on their work and behave like company directors. "They teach during the day and in the evening, they watch their favourite cartoons, putting their research work aside. How can such scholars attract funding," the don asked. He also warned scholars who are lucky to get funding not to abuse the same, "the Kenyan way of diverting resources". Waudo said since MKU underscored research and innovation, it had establish a full-fledged directorate to manage the same. The VC said the role of universities is to undertake research, teaching and service provision. "Any varsity that does not undertake the three components is not serious," he said. He said lack of research is what has seen Kenya rely on fish supplies from China. "This is not because the Chinese pray more than we do, but its because they undertake serious research to produce enough fish for their huge population and for export." Waudo said the 5iiRC2018 conference will address such issues. The conference shall bring together practitioners, academicians, policy makers, governmental and non-governmental organisations.
