Until their debacle in Dar-es-Salaam where the players refused to pick their Cecafa Kagame Cup bronze medals allegedly until they shared the prize money, Gor Mahia had been cruising on the domestic front and causing ripples on the continent.
Now all that had been hampered by a misjudgment by the players who will need to prove otherwise to their respective supporters ahead of their Caf Confederations Cup Group ‘E’ clash against Yanga today.
It’s however, hard to see how the team will self motivate after the Dar fallout. The onus will be on head coach Dylan Kerr and his assistant Zedekiah Otieno, who the players hold in high esteem in the hierarchy to ensure they have the right frame of mind to get the job done against Yanga.
With two points from as many matches, K’Ogallo are in the driving seat to clinch at least the second qualifying spot from the group that consists of leaders USM Alger and Rayon Sport, who meet in the other match up in Kigali.
While the K’Ogallo players might still be feeling unappreciated by the club bosses, it must not be lost on them of the riches that await them should they reach the knockout face of this competition.
Rwandan skipper Jacques Tuyisenge alongside inform duo of George Odhiambo and Francis Kahata will be pivotal to Gor’s fortunes going forward. At the back with Joash Onyango suspended, Charles Momanyi will get the nod to partner skipper Haron Shakava. Victory today will shatter the doubts that have started to emerge over the team’s focus or even desire to succeed on the pitch.
Tanzanians’ most successful club have been a pale shadow of themselves for the last couple of years and having scored no goal in their two matches thus far including the draw at home to Rayon, it’s hard to see where they will get the inspiration to do the damage even to a Gor team that has taken their eyes off the ball.
