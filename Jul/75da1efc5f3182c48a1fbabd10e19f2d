A robbery with violence suspected escaped the police yesterday and jumped into Manguo Swamp, Limuru, next to the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Motorists pulled over their vehicles an joined residents to watch the Administration Police wade the cold waters to arrest the suspect. There was a traffic snarl-up on the highway and Limuru town road. AP commander Gitonga Gathumi said the suspect was involved in a series of robberies at Kwambira, Kamirithu, Ngarariga, Manguo and Limuru town. Motorists blocked each other as others overlapped. When the APs realised the suspect was swimming to cross the 2km swamp, about 5ft deep, to escape, they both removed their clothes and jumped in the water. Resident Milkah Njeri said, “The two officers are brave. The water is so cold and the surface of the swamp is slippery. They had not prepared to swim.” Motorists, passengers and residents obstructed the police as they tried to pull the suspect out, with each struggling to see him. Gathumi said other angmembers had been arrested earlier. “We were looking for two suspects who have been involved in a series of robberies. He was mentioned last week in a case in which a teacher was robbed,” he said. “When this suspect ran away his colleague was arrested and handcuffed.” The AP boss said they will hand over the suspects to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers at Tigoni police station for further investigation. Some of the residents asked the government to commend the officers, saying they went out of their way. Click here for the latest political news
