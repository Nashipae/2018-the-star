Comedian Njugush has laughed off accusations of storyline jacking by an upcoming comedian known by the street moniker JB Molex. Responding to the claims, he said, "These two videos are world's apart, but anything to calm your nerves." Adding, "Weee sjawahi cheka hivi budah.... Kama ningekua nakutegemea for content naona ningekua na video chache sana... so from now I'll be careful to use words such as World Cup, make up etc nisi kucopy." An angry JB Molex responded, "I won't engage, online utajitetea, but at the back of your head you know the truth. I serve a God who rewards, and my Bible tells me, God will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. We will meet in future and we will all laugh about this."
