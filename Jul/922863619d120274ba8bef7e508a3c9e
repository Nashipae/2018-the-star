Small-scale millers have complained of the high cost of fortifying maize and wheat flour. The government plans to improve health and nutritional status of poor Kenyans through fortification of flour. United Trade Millers Association vice chairman Ken Nyaga yesterday said most small-scale millers are unable to meet the cost of food fortification, which is between Sh700,000 and Sh4 million. “The cost of food fortification, which includes buying the machines and testing maize and wheat flour for standards is an expensive affair for most small millers,” he said. Nyaga urged the government to subsidise the cost of the fortification or acquire the machines and sell to them on loan. Millers also took issue with the fortification process of maize and wheat flour by Kebs, which is long and expensive. “It takes about two months for Kebs to issue a fortification mark for between Sh30,000 and Sh50,000,” Nyaga said. Samuel Ochieng’ from the Consumer Information Network said fortification is not just a fancy idea, but has lifelong implications for consumers and must be done properly. Veronica Kirogo, head of nutrition and dietetics at the Health ministry said food fortification is among the high impact nutrition interventions identified by the government to reduce malnutrition.
