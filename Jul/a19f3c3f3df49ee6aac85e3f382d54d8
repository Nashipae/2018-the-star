National Sevens champions Kabras have been drawn in a tricky Pool ‘A’ alongside Strathmore Leos, Mwamba and Mean Machine in Prinsloo Sevens.
The sugar millers, who sacked their coach Charles Cadovillis last month, still have their bulk of the players who won them the crown last year. They include Malik Habil, Fabian Olando, Nick Barasa and new signing Kevin Keegan.
They will, however, be without playmaker Brian Tanga and Dan Sikuta who are away with the Kenya Sevens squad for the Rugby Sevens World Cup in San Francisco, USA and Ugandan import Phillip Wokorach representing Uganda at the same tournament.
Last season’s runners up Homeboyz have a date with Quins, Blak Blad and Kisumu RFC in Pool ‘B’. Resolution Impala top Pool ‘C’ and will clash with last season’s surprise package Menengai Oilers, Western Bulls and Mombasa. KCB lead the charge in Pool ‘D’ and face the hosts Nakuru, Nondies and debutants and Nzoia Sugar.
The top two teams qualify for the Main Cup quarter-finals while the teams that finish third and fourth will drop to the Challenge Trophy.
As it has been the recent trend, the circuit once again features a second tier competition which also kicks off this weekend and will be played alongside the main event. The opening round in Nakuru will be a 24-team affair as teams seek to secure promotion to the top tier competition at the second round of the circuit in Eldoret on July 28.
Catholic Monks are top seeds in the second tier category in Nakuru and headline Pool ‘A’ alongside Northern Suburbs, Citam Kisumu and newbies Bomet. Makueni are in Pool ‘B’ with Embu, Nakuru KITI and another set of newbies in Administration Police while Pool ‘C’ pits Daystar Falcons against Egerton Wasps, TUK and Molo.
Kisii are in Pool ‘D’ with Kiambu, KCA Stormers and Bungoma while Mount Kenya University, MMUST, USIU and Mbale make up Pool ‘E’. KCA, Comras, Eldoret and Ngong round off Pool ‘F’.
