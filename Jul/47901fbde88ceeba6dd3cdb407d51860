The Nairobi County will build trauma centres in four hospitals; Mama Lucy Kibaki, Pumwani, Mbagathi and Mutuini, Governor Mike Sonko has said. Trauma centres are well-equipped and staffed hospitals to provide care for patients suffering from major traumatic injuries such as road accidents, gunshots wounds or any other accident. "This will help reduce the number of patients at Kenyatta National Hospital, which should now become strictly a referral hospital," said Sonko. KNH has been the main referral hospital in Kenya for decades, and the growth in the population of Nairobi has put a lot of pressure on the facility. “We have recognized the congestion at KNH, therefore, my government has provided money in its budget to build trauma centres at our four hospitals; Mama Lucy, Pumwani, Mbagathi and Mutuini,” said Governor Sonko. Speaking during the opening of a Pediatric Wing at KNH on Thursday, Sonko said his administration takes health matters seriously. He said in this 2018/19 Financial Year, they have committed 21 per cent of the Nairobi County revenue towards the healthcare provision. “We have set up maternity wings in Kayole South and Baba Dogo health centres, an oxygen plant in Mama Lucy and a Renal Unit at Mbagathi providing life-saving dialysis for thousands of people,” he said. He said to ensure a steady supply of medicines and medical supplies to all our facilities, his administration has already paid the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority KEMSA at a total of Sh51million. Meanwhile, earlier during the day, Nairobi County Health Executive Hiten Majevdia and County Secretary Peter Kariuki received the Cuban doctors who will be deployed in hospitals within Nairobi.
