Kitui Health chief officer Richard Muthoka has raised the alarm over increasing HIV infections despite efforts to reduce the spread of the virus. Muthoka said Kitui is still categorised as a high-burden county at position 19 despite a reduction in infection rates from 4.8 per cent in 2012 to 4.4 per cent in 2016. He attributed new infections to residents reluctance to be tested. Muthoka said at least 28,918 people are living with the virus in Kitui. Of them, 1,846 are children who got the virus through mother-to-child infection. Transmission rate stands at 19.4 per cent, Muthoka said. “I’m calling upon partners to mobilise more resources to help pregnant women access counseling and HIV testing services,” Muthoka said. He spoke at the Kitui Referral Hospital where he launched the Kenya Population Based HIV Impact Assessment (Kenphia) program me on Thursday. The survey will provide data on HIV prevalence and measures to improve the health of infected persons. It will also determine levels of new infections. The survey will also show statistics on the progress made towards realisation of the UNaids targets that envisage zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero HIV-Aids-related deaths. “It will give firsthand information to confirm our progress and address the existing gaps,” Muthoka said. Kenphia chief executive Francis Ogolla said the survey will provide insights on how to prevent new infections and put patients on viral suppression. “Participants will learn about their health and be provided with information about prevention, care and management of the virus,” Ogolla said.
