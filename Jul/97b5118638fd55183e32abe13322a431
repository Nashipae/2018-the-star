Nation Media Group has lost some big names this year, including Larry Madowo, who joined BBC Africa, and Jamila Mohammed, who joined rival station Citizen. Others include Nimrod Taabu and Rashid Abdalla. The latest to leave NTV is Hudheifa Okaash. The young lad, who has worked at the media house for three years, took to social media to announce the news: “This marks the end of my journey at @ntvkenya. I had an amazing 3 years there, largely because of the wonderful people I have had the opportunity to work with. “Goodbyes are never easy. I’ve enjoyed my time there and value the friendship, wisdom and guidance I received. I look forward to the next chapter of my Media journey. God bless.”
