Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has told Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waititu to repair deteriorating medical facilities. Kuria cited lack of medicine, blankets and underutilisation of facilities, which he said tarnishes the county’s image. “It is a shame that despite Gatundu Level 5 Hospital having an ICU facility, patients do not enjoy the services two years after its installation,” the MP said yesterday. Kuria added that many lives would be saved if the ICU was well utilised. Recent media reports have put the Kiambu government on the spot over alleged sharing of beds by patients at the Level 5 Hospital. Kuria was with Murang’a woman representative Sabina Chege, who is also the Parliamentary Health Committee chairperson. She said she will move a motion to change the management of all Level 5 hospitals from the counties to the national government. She said politicians should address the Kiambu hospital problem and lobby for the facility to receive a conditional grant. The two spoke in Karembu village, Gatundu South, during the opening of Gakunju Memorial Primary School named after former Gatundu MP Zackary Gakunju. The school is built on land donated by Gakunju’s family and constructed through the NG-CDF. Speaking in Thika town last week, Kiambu Health chief officer Andrew Toro said the biggest problem lies in overstretched facilities.
