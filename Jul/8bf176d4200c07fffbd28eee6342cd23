Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has urged farmers in the Rift Valley to reduce maize production, saying it’s no longer profitable. “The future is bleak for farmers who continue to grow maize because it’s an unreliable business,” Mandago said at the AIC Nganiat Church on Sunday. He was accompanied by West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo. The governor said farmers are suffering because the National Cereals and Produce Board is yet to pay them Sh5 billion for maize delivered last year. Further, maize takes more water than other crops. The armyworm also has damaged the maize crop. Mandago wants the farmers to diversify to other crops like potatoes and flowers for export. He said he would start a door-to-door campaign to educate farmers on the need to diversity. He cited coffee, drought-tolerant boma rhodes grass and macadamia, which are more profitable. The governor met British Deputy High Commissioner Susie Kitchens on Monday to discuss how to help maize farmers diversify. The farmers have been demanding more than Sh5 billion pay for maize delivered to the NCPB since last December. Director of the Kenya Farmers Association Kipkorir Menjo said the government should increase funding to agriculture to more than 10 per cent of the budget. Chairman of the Kenya National Farmers Union Musa Barno and Menjo said the Sh1.4 billion to buy maize this year was inadequate. Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich allocated Sh4.3 billion for subsidised fertiliser and Sh300 million to combat the fall armyworm.
