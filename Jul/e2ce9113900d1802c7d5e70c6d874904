A dormitory at Nyahururu Boys High School went up in flames on Saturday evening. The cause of the fire had not been established. It housed 76 students. None was injured but they did not salvage their belongings. Guards informed the police who mobilised firefighters. They put out the fire before it spread to other buildings. Some students escaped to the neighbouring Nyahururu Sports Club but returned later. Board of management chairman Raphael Kangâ€™ethe said the students had been calm and there were no signs of tension and unrest. Nyandarua county commissioner Boaz Cherutich said they were investigating.
