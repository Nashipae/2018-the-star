STARRING: Omari Hardwick, Michael Rainey Jr., Joseph Sikora, 50 Cent, Lela Loren, Naturi Naughton GENRE: Crime drama SEASON PREMIER: July 1  The shock that hit viewers after the season 4 finale was incomparable to any we had seen on television in a long time. Killing the sweetest most angelic character on TV was the evilest yet paradoxically the most intriguing thing we have ever seen on TV. Perhaps it is because of this that season 5 of Power just seems to start off on the most dramatically engaging note. After the tragic death of his daughter Raina, Ghost forges deadly plans and even more questionable alliances. He partners with his old friends Tommy and Kanan to retaliate on Dre after he turned against them. But Dre’s unimaginable friendship with Ghost’s son Tariq saves him from the deathly grasp of Tommy’s men. Meanwhile, Ghost’s unlikely alliance is not the only one amazing viewers. Ghost’s former wife Tasha and his former mistress Angela seem to be the only ones making clear-headed moves that will save everyone. Their alliance is the only voice of reason in a chaotic, dangerous world. There’s a reality trait that Power possesses that draws the viewer in so deep that one wishes they could reach into the television and slap the silly out of Tariq. Power speaks to the universal plea that the innocent are always the ones to bear the heavy cost of a dangerous world. There is no question of the Show’s ability to intrigue, provoke or entertain us. Unlike some shows that started off amazingly well but ended so badly (no one can forget the catastrophe that was Heroes); Power has manged — for five years — to keep its momentum without veering off the tracks.  Star Rating: 5/5
