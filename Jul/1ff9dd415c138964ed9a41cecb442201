The Council of Governors has said rising cases of malnutrition, mainly among children in arid and semi-arid counties, are holding back gains of devolution. Chairman Josphat Nanok said lack of investments in child nutrition has hindered economic development. “This represents a serious concern to a country’s and county future development, given that impacts of stunting are irreversible and associated with impaired cognitive abilities,” he said. Nanok said the recent drought that affected majority of ASAL areas led to a decline in school attendance. In his speech read by Turkana deputy governor Peter Emuria, Nanok urged ASAL counties to work together to improve the lives of schoolchildren. Emuria spoke at the end of a four-day Frontier County Development Council meeting in Naivasha.
