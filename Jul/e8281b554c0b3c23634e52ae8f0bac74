Kenya Power will place newly recruited managers on contract and cut its administrative units from 10 to seven in ongoing restructuring. This is a departure from the past when senior management were on permanent and pensionable terms, while field staff were contracted. The new structure will have five directorates – finance, corporate services, operations, energy supply management and commercial directorate. Each business unit will have a financial and a technical manager reporting directly to the CEO. “We want to optimise our resources in order to enhance operational, technical and financial efficiency,” said an insider. The new commercial directorate groups customers in three categories – large consumers, small commercial users, and domestic and emerging users.
