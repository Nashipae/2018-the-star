Dida, real name Dianarose Damian, is an upcoming artiste in Kenya of Tanzanian origin. She is married to Kenyan videographer and singer Richie G. Speaking to Word Is, she recounted the struggle to make it in the industry. “The greatest challenge I have faced so far is lack of support from the already established artistes, because sometimes they even ask for money to be featured in your songs,” Dida said. She has been singing for a while but started professional recording in 2012. After meeting up with her husband, who is a music producer and video director, she started working on songs because Richie also runs a music recording studio. Dida would hang around the studio most of the time, witness sessions and video shoots, and it encouraged her to start recording. She has four solo songs and three collaborations out, the two main solos being Zama and Alarm. Locally and internationally, Dida is inspired musically by Tiwa Savage, Ciara and Vanessa Mdee. She is currently working on a few collaborations, which will be coming out soon. She has a new song titled Badili, and she says it is inspired by relationships. “In my songs, I have talked so much about relationships, basically trying to tell the ladies not to change their personality just to please their men and even the society,” Dida said.
