Police are holding two suspects in connection with the murder of a Thika medic two weeks ago.
A gun was recovered from the duo. They are suspected to be part of a gang that has been terrorising residents and allegedly committed a series of murders and robberies in Thika and its neighbourhood.
Police said the suspects are part of a gang that attacked Murang’a-based doctor Kagimbi Kimani, who escaped death after he was shot four times in Ngoingwa home, Thika, two weeks ago. His wife, Charity Wanjiru, who was a nurse in Thika, died after she was shot three times in the chest. The gangsters waylaid the couple as they drove home at night.
 After the attack, police said, the gunmen fled in a car and kidnapped a resident whom they later dumped in Gachagi, Thika, after robbing him of his mobile phone.
Thika deputy county commissioner Douglas Mutai said the two have been linked to the attempted murder of a Gatanga-based trader in Murang’a county.
They will be taken to court tomorrow as police investigate reports that a Gatanga politician is part of the plot. The politician and an aide had been arrested and released in unclear circumstances.
