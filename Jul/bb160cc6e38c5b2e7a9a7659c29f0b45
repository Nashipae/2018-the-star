Six international acts will be jetting into the country in August for the Terminal Music Weekend at the KICC. The Terminal Music Weekend, which is the biggest music weekend ever
held in Nairobi, will feature Keri Hilson, Bobby V and Horace alongside
local talent Habida, Sage and June Gachui on the first day. Big Shaq, WSTRN and Big Tobz alongside local talent Khaligraph Jones –
who just dropped an album – Steph Kapella and Shukid will perform on
the second day. The two shows will be graced by DJ Adrian, DJ Joe Grinds, DJ Pinye, DJ Stylez, G Money and Mixmaster Lenny. The
Terminal Music Weekend will be held annually. It is poised to be a game
changer in the Kenyan entertainment industry as it will ensure Kenyan
acts are not sidelined and are accorded the same amount of time and
attention on stage as international acts. The event was named terminal as its aim is to bring people together from all walks of life just like an airport terminal. The tickets will be sold on August 3 in three waves for Sh2,500, Sh3,500, Sh4,000 and Sh5,000. On the second day they will go for Sh2,000, Sh2,750, Sh3,500 and Sh4,000 depending on how early you buy the ticket.
