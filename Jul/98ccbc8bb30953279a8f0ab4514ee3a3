A driver alleged to have conspired with other former employees of St Mary’s Mission Hospital to steal more than Sh153 million was on Friday charged in a Nairobi court. Seth Bwosi who appeared before Milimani senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku also faces another charge of money laundering. He pleaded not guilty. The court heard that on diverse dates between December 29, 2017 and January 29, 2018 at Prime Bank Riverside branch in Nairobi county, the accused conspired to steal Sh 153,468,000 from St Mary’s Mission Hospital. The second count states the accused received Sh153,468,000 which he reasonably ought to have known formed part of proceeds of stealing. A lawyer representing the Bwosi accused the hospital management of instigating charges on anyone who is a friend of former director William Fryda, an American priest who is also facing the same charges before another court. He said his client was a driver of Fryda.
