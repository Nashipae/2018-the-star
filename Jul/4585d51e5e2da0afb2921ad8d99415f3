Students of Kisii High School have been fined Sh1,800 each for repairs following the torching of a dormitory. The learners, who number at least 1,900, paid this amount on Wednesday when they started reporting back following the closure of the school on July 11. The fire destroyed Wire House that accommodated 175 learners.

They denied the charges before senior resident magistrate Ezekiel Obina and were freed on Sh50,000 cash bail each. Obina ordered the prosecution to avail witness statements so their lawyers can prepare defenses. The case will be mentioned on August 20 and heard on December 3. As their students reported back, parents who accompanied their sons told the Star that times were tough but that the amount was fair. One said they had been worried about a high figure which would have made matters worse for those who struggle to pay school fees. Some of the parents said they were ready to work with the management in guiding and counselling the students. "We urge our sons to use available avenues to raise their grievances instead of burning dormitories," Joseph Ratemo said. “Destroying of school property is a punishment to parents because they are the ones who pay the fines." The Education ministry said parents will pay for the damage caused by students amid a wave of unrest. Also read: Parents will pay for school fire damage Click here for the latest political news
