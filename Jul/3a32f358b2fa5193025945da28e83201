Kenyan rapper Klin K has finally spoken about a criminal case that forced him out of the music industry for a year. The rapper, who became famous for a diss song that hit out at Khaligraph Jones, has finally shared how a bar brawl landed him in jail. The rapper, who is now out and rebuilding his career, says he got into a fight at a club during a night out but didn’t think much of it at the time. “I went out as usual and ended up rubbing someone the wrong way so they confronted me, the confrontation turned violent and blows were exchanged,” Klin says. Little did he know that the person he fought with was from a wealthy family and would later press assault charges. “Cops dragged me from class days after the altercation. I was shocked as I thought the incident ended at the club.” Days later he was in remand awaiting his trial at the Kibera law courts, where he was told that the sentence for assault charges is a five-year jail term. It was then that he started making efforts to reach out to the man who was pressing the charges. “After begging and negotiations, they agreed on a compromise to drop the case, leading to my release,” the rapper says. Klin says had it not been for God’s mercies, he would be serving a five-year jail term. The rapper has turned over a new leaf. He has quit drugs and substance abuse and is back to recording. He has released a song, Let You Go, to mark this change.
