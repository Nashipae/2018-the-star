The county will monitor garbage collection at night to curb illegal dumping, especially by street boys, in Embakasi South subcounty. Anyone found illegal dumping will be arrested. County executive for Environment Larry Wambua told the Star that illegal dumping in slums is a big problem. Subcounty administrators will conduct an awareness programme for residents on proper garbage management, Wambua said yesterday. Embakasi East subcounty administrator John Sarumi said slums produce a lot of garbage because of their high population. “We have people doing illegal dumping at night and this has raised concern because the dumping is done close to residential houses,” Sarumi said. County officials suspect street boys who hang around dumping sites burn the garbage at night. Last week, residents of Jamaica and Sinai villages complained about illegal dumping in residential areas. This has led to poor sanitation and a rise in respiratory diseases, they said. Joyce Kathira, a mother of four children, said yesterday the dangerous smoke from burning garbage is a health hazard especially for children. “We are forced to lock our children in the house to prevent them from inhaling the smoke. However, they still end up inhaling it and develop diseases,” Kathira said. Mtongwe river passing near the slums is filthy due to daily dumping of garbage. Residents worry it will overflow during heavy rains.
