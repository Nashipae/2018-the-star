Nyce Wanjeri, alias Shiru, is one of the best Kenyan actresses. The Auntie Boss actress is well known for her housegirl character in the local TV show. Shiru has been nominated for the Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards (AMVCA), and she says she was overwhelmed with joy, laughter and tears after hearing the news. She was nominated among other big names in Nollywood, such as Rita Dominic and Banky Wellinton's wife Edesua Etomi. “I cried when I heard I had been nominated. This is a big deal for me. I never thought I would have been nominated for the best actress in series/comedy. I have been nominated with other big names in Nollywood. Let's vote and bring this award back home,” she said. Shiru has spoken up about solicitation of sexual favours in the acting fraternity. She has faced many problems in the industry, which she says is the same case for other top actresses. Shiru admits that there is indeed sexual favour solicitation to get yourself a job as an actress. “There are those who are like that, like if I don't get you to bed, then you won't have the job. It doesn't make sense to me. Everyone that I work with knows very well that I have set standards and boundaries in my life." The actress is happily married with one child. "Yes, I'm off the market and marriage works. It has its own challenges but you need to understand each other."
