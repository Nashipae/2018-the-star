Strong anti-competitive laws have posed a great challenge for East African enterprises to hit regional and global rankings of Amazon and Google. Chairman East African Business Community Nick Nesbitt has said some structures in EAC governments are quick to declare companies as monopoly industry players limiting scope of operation to one country. “Such structures short-change the ability of companies to grow, limiting them within the EAC boundaries whereas they have the potential of operating as global investors” Nesbitt said. The government sent a proposal to Parliament to declare mobile telephony Safaricom a dominant player in 2015. The proposal required Safaricom to split its businesses and share some of its platforms including its facilities and M-Pesa platform and also give a chance for other player to grow. Nesbitt also faulted high risks associated with taxation and non-tariff barriers that hinder free trade in the EAC. “Trading policies have been subject quick to constant changing in different countries. Lack of certainty on predictable policies makes trading riskier, posing a challenge of access to capital for growth. There is need for harmonization of laws to benefit the private sector players,” Nesbitt added. Nesbitt has committed to engage trade permanent secretaries in member counties to provide a clear legal framework for the removal of non-tariff barriers create a competitive trading ground for the players. Nesbitt said there is need for regional integration to encourage free movement of goods and services and build private-sector led economies within EA. “Companies have been focused on collusion in the sale of certain commodities instead of joint ventures. Why would countries fight to export vegetables to Europe? Why would we look abroad for economical solutions?” he posed. Nesbitt succeeds Jim Kabeho and will head a 22 member executive committee drawn from the five EAC countries in the financial year 2018/2019.
