Too much politicking and weak institutions could hamper the war on corruption, Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru said yesterday. She welcomed the lifestyle audit ordered by President Uhuru Kenyatta as a “big step forward”. “This is why the President has rightly opted for the audit,” Waiguru said in her speech at Chatham House in London. She said structures for created accountability are weak even though the Constitution provided a useful platform for creation of strong systems. The Council of Governor vice chairperson is among three guest speakers invited to lecture on devolution at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. She said the main problem in Kenyan politics is the pressure from families that want to benefit from their relative’s time in office. “Regarding accountability, a danger is that the fight against corruption becomes politicised and used by individuals to harm their enemies. Social media can be a key tool in the fight for greater transparency,” Waiguru said. Without civic education, citizens lack the ability to demand accountability from all public officers, she said. Waiguru praised devolution for promoting gender equality and inclusion in line with the Project Kenya. She said the government is committed to making devolution work through allocations to the counties. The county boss said Kenya lags behind in women representation in leadership. She said Tanzania and Rwanda are ahead and Kenya must improve. “I hope after the next election we have at least 11 women governors,” she said.
