KCB has declined to give details of a private account allegedly holding Sh18.7 million belonging to Vihiga county. The funds were deposited by Sports CEC Marita Agufana and Finance CEC Alfred Indeche who were impeached last week. An ad hoc committee led by Banja MCA Collins Ayugu had written to KCB Mbale branch manager Boniface Azenga requesting details of the bank account. KCBâ€™s response, dated July 24, said the bank would not divulge further information of the account due to customer confidentiality. Agufana said she transferred the money to a private account to keep it safe from the national Treasury upon expiry 2017/2018 financial year. The funds were allocated for sports activities in Vihiga county in July. Others who were impeached over the issue are chief officers Livingstone Imbayi (Finance) and Clement Manyulu (Sports). The impeachment of the four senior county government officers is a major setback for Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo. Yesterday, journalists were thrown out of a meeting the ad hoc committee convened to discuss the issue.
