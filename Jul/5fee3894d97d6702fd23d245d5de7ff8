Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos has warned the youth against overdrinking. He said on Monday some residents are drunk throughout the day and cannot contribute to community development. Tolgos said bars will forfeit their licences if the situation does not stop. He asked alcohol retail outlets to comply with regulations. Tolgos said too much drinking threatens the region’s socioeconomic development. "Some of the drunkards call me at night complaining that alcohol had made them poor," he said in Kapsoo village, Keiyo South. The county chief said Soy North in Kerio Valley is one of the worst-hit areas. He cited Emsea and Chepsigot trading centres as dens of retailers flouting regulations and operating throughout the day. "The bars have been selling hard drinks. They ruin the lives of many young people who should have been productive — considering the agricultural potential of the region and business opportunities," Tolgos said. He said “strangers scramble” to establish new bars because of the “disgusting rise in demand for liquor”. "They’re not interested in decent businesses." Deputy Governor Wesley Rotich and Agriculture executive Shadrack Yatich accompanied Tolgos. They urged residents to exploit their farming potential to transform lives .
