Former KBC news anchor Roncliffe Odit has spoken out for the first time since landing a bigger job at BBC Swahili team at Riverside early this year. Speaking to Word Is, Roncliffe said he is super excited to be back to what he has always loved doing in media. "I do miss TV a lot, but again radio was my first love. I worked in radio for nine years before joining KBC TV, so I feel I have gone back to my first love." His experience is so far is wonderful. "Working in an international media house is a whole different experience because there is no more running around for press conferences, but getting unique ideas and stories to report that will appear to a global audience." "I arrive at work at 11am, have an editorial meeting at 12 noon, discussing the day's stories and how we will treat them. Then we start working on those stories as they come from around the globe, and at 6pm, we are ready to present the show. "The environment is good although a bit challenging, but I have a very supportive team, so I am catching up."
