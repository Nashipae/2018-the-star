The Thai boys trapped in a cave for two weeks have written letters to their parents, saying "don't worry... we are all strong". The handwritten notes include requests for food, including fried chicken. "Teacher, don't give us lots of homework!" read one. The team's coach also offered his "apologies" to the parents in a separate letter. The 12 boys and their coach were exploring the cave when they became trapped by flood waters on 23 June. In his letter, the 25-year-old coach Ekkapol Chantawong reassured parents, saying: "Dear all kids' parents, now all of them are fine, the rescue team is treating us well. "And I promise I will take care of the kids as best as I can. Thank you for everyone's that come to help. "I also sincerely apologise to the kids' parents." The group sent their notes after receiving letters from their families, in their first communication since attempts to establish a phone line inside the cave failed earlier this week. The group were found inside the cave by British rescue divers on Monday, 10 days after they went missing. They were perched on a rock shelf in a small chamber about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. Teams of Thai and international divers have since supplied them with food, oxygen and medical attention, but there are mounting concerns about the oxygen level in the chamber, which officials said had fallen to 15%. The usual level is 21%. The authorities in Thailand say an air line into the cave has now been successfully installed. Click here for the latest political news
