A Kiambu court yesterday heard that illegal meetings organised by Kenyatta University students led to destruction of Sh102 million property. A director of security was testifying in a case in which seven students have been charged with the damage. Victor Nangacho, Dominic Orwa, Trevor Agoi, David Amisi, Eric Masila, George Nyamweya and David Kebas pleaded not guilty and are out Sh1 million bond each. Philip Ndwiga told senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo that the students met at a place called Frustrations Corner on main campus and demanded that they be allowed to cook in the hostels, vice chancellor Paul Wainaina be removed from office and suspended students be reinstated. “It started on November 13 last year, when accused person Kebaso, a suspended student, called for a meeting with students. I called him and informed him of the implications, but he defied and went ahead with the meeting. It was attended by about 3,000 students,” Ndwiga said. He said the learners razed tuck shops and set one hostel and an admission block ablaze. Police were called in to restore order, he said. Ndegwa said the students continued agitating their demands for two days but were eventually overpowered by the varsity’s security team. “A student association leadership election was to be held on November 14, but the students, after meeting, turned unruly and started destroying property,” he said. Ndwiga said a disciplinary committee identified the students. The hearing continues today.
