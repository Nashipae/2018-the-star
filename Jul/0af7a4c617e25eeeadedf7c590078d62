Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua has
cordial relations with Deputy President William Ruto and is not fighting him in
any way contrary to insinuations by some politicians. On Monday, the Star reported that politicians
allied to the DP were lamenting about State House officials allegedly working
against the DP. The MPs and a governor who spoke to the Star in confidence accused
Kinyua, State House Comptroller Kinuthia Mbugua and Interior PS Karanja Kibicho
of working against the DP’s interests. Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wa claimed that
the people who are fighting the DP are the same ones who masterminded the
charges against the former Eldoret North MP at the International Criminal
Court. The Star has established that Kinyua, in
fact, had nothing to do with ICC as claimed by Ichung’wa. Contrary to claims by the politicians,
Kinyua  has good working relations with all public servants and works closely with the President and his Deputy in managing Government business. Read: Ruto allies: These are the people against DP Click here for the latest political news
