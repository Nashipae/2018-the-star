A body was found on Wednesday under the footbridge next to St Marks church in Westlands, Nairobi. The identity of the person could not be established immediately due to the state of the body. Abubakar Abdi, one of the refugees who live under the flyover, however told the Star that the person must have been one of them. "He can't have been a chokoraa (street urchin) or a Kenyan national. He might have hidden there to evade police," he said. "There was a police raid on June 2 ... that was the last time we saw him so we assumed he had run to another place. He might have died from hunger because he was not sick." Abdi said police make arrests at night, especially between 3am and 5am. Those apprehended are taken into their custody or transported to Kakuma refugee camp, he said. It took the officers more than one hour to collect the body which was taken to City Mortuary. The refugees live under the bridge along Waiyaki Way while seeking help from the nearby UNHCR office.
