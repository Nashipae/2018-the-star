School heads who do not provide sanitary pads to girls have been put on notice following reports some of the students miss classes during their period. Speaking at Giriftu Primary School in Wajir West constituency yesterday, Women Representative Fatuma Gedi said, “I am forewarning school heads who, instead of supporting our girls by giving them sanitary pads that have been provided, are the ones frustrating this effort. I will not allow this to happen under my watch.” Her office provided 25,000 pads for the six constituencies, covering four months from July. Last year, Treasury allocated Sh470 million to buy pads.
