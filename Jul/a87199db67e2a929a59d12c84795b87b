A determination on the suitability of Laikipia county secretary nominee Karanja Njora has been deferred to Wednesday. County assembly's Labour committee chairman George Karuiru on Thursday moved the deferment motion saying MCAs had not perused a report on Njora's vetting. The committee vetted Njora and deputy county secretary nominee Amos Punden.The report was tabled in the house on Wednesday. Sources said MCAs opted to defer the matter until a petition challenging Governor Nderitu Muriithi's election is determined. The Court of Appeal is set to rule on the petition on Tuesday.
