Sugar prices continue to rise as a shortage occasioned by the ongoing crackdown has led to low supply. A kilo of sugar is retailing at Sh125 in some Nairobi supermarkets including Quickmart, Tuskys and Cleanshelf, from Sh90 last month. The same amount is being sold at Sh150 in estate retail shops. A two kilo packet is selling at Sh250 in the same stores. Retailers said the sweetener could rise to Sh200 a kilo if the situation the shortage persists. "My supplier has informed me that his Ugandan importer where he sources sugar, has been barred from bringing the commodity into the country," a retailer in Kiambu said. In Meru, supermarkets are selling sugar at between Sh250 and Sh260 for a two kilo packet. Wholesalers are selling a 50 kilo bag at Sh6,000, leaving retailers a window of at least Sh20 to Sh30 per kilo in profit margins. "What should I buy? Which sugar is safe?" that was all a customer asked as she scanned through the brands at a Westlands supermarket. A spot check in local restaurants did not indicate any changes in prices of sweetened beverages, with a cup of tea still selling at between Sh25 and Sh60 in hotels in downtown Nairobi. Susan Njeru is seeking options to sweeten her children’s drinks. Although raw honey can be difficult to get, Caroline said she plans to buy hers from a trader who fetches his supplies from Marigat in Baringo county. A half-kilo tin of raw honey sells at Sh450. However, family doctor Joy Mugambi, recommend that users try other means of sweetening their beverages. She said this is the time to rethink whether the additive is good for general health, adding a number of non-communicable diseases, including obesity, dental problems, hypertension and cancer can be linked to the use of sugar. Kenya’s sugar industries produce 400,000 tonnes against a demand of 600,000 tonnes annually.
