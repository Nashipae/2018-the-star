Crooked pharmacists are selling rape drugs to criminals, the Pharmacy and Poisons Board has said. An investigation in Nairobi and Mombasa shows some prescription drugs are fuelling crime. Eleven pharmacists were prosecuted in Mombasa last month. Police are expected to arrest more in Nairobi. The board head of crime investigation and enforcement unit Dennis Otieno said Rohypnol, a hypnotic depressant known in the streets as bugizi, is a date-rape drug. Rohypnol is a colourless and odourless pill. It is mixed with a flavoured drink or alcohol, affecting the central nervous system and creates a drunken feeling. Users experience blackouts and disorientation and may not recall events. “These drugs have become a big part of crime in Mombasa. Youths as young as 12 are engaging in mugging and robbery,” Otieno said. Although Rohypnol is illegal in the US, it is available by prescription in most countries, including Kenya. It is used to treat insomnia, or as a pre-anesthetic. Otieno said some unlicensed pharmacists sell diazepam tablets, used to treat depression and anxiety, without prescription. Colloquially known as ‘C5’, diazepam triggers euphoric effects and users feel “there is no care in the world”. The pharmacy board has tightened rules to rein in on the outlets, some of which have been closed. At least 900 illegal pharmacies have been closed since 2016 across the country. In June, board registrar Fred Siyoi issued a public notice to licensed pharmacists dealing with Codeine-containing syrups and other medicinal products to adhere to the law. Board head of inspection Jacinta Wasike said, “We have instructed distributors of narcotics and psychotropic substances to provide distribution and returns of the said drugs to the PPB offices. All quantities must have references that can be used in inspections and audits.” Click here for the latest political stories
