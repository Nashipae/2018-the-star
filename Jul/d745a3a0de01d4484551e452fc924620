Political parties lack democracy and are riddled with corruption, nepotism and tribalism, two Embu independent MCAs have said. Ngari Mbaka (Mavuria) and Nathan Mwari (Nthawa) wants party nomination losers to be allowed to run as independent candidates. During last year's General Election, most losers were allowed to run as independents. But the Registrar of Political Parties wants Lucy Ndung'u wants them barred, saying allowing them to run is ill-advised. Speaking to the Star in Embu town on Monday, the two MCAs said Ndung'u should instead focus on making party primaries credible. Mbaka said running as an independent candidates provides the opportunity for politicians to revenge for injustices meted on them by their political parties. “Political parties are only interested in money during the primaries. They are in it for businesses because you can’t win the nomination unless you bribe your way out,” Mbaka said. "Getting the nomination certificate depends on how smart in making deals one is and the connections s/he has within the party. It is not the best candidates who win nominations." He said most independents are often pushed out of their parties against their wish. Mbaka said he was rigged out in the Jubilee Party primaries despite winning by more than 3,000 votes. He said an unpopular candidate would have become the Mavuria ward representative had he not sought clearance as an independent candidate. Ngari said party nominations are often marred with chaos, corruption and selfish interests. He said blocking losers from running as independents will limit voters' choices. “We shall mobilise our people to oppose the amendment if it comes for public hearing," Ngari said.
