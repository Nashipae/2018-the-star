Two KWS rangers were interdicted on Tuesday over the death of a 12-year-old black rhino in a poaching incident at the Lake Nakuru National Park. The two were on duty on Monday night when poachers struck and carted away the rhino's horns. "The rangers were interdicted pending investigations by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) into their culpability," a statement by KWS corporate communications manager Paul Udoto reads in part. The National Intelligence Service and DCI are also assisting KWS in tracking the suspected poachers. The KWS Canine Unit was deployed at the scene in the morning but lost track of the suspects. "Several security teams are involved in the case," Udoto said adding that a post-mortem has been conducted on the rhino to determine to exact cause of the death. Senior Park Warden Catherine Wambani said the incident happened near Nderi gate located at Mwariki area in the southeastern side of the park. A police officer privy to the investigations said that the rhino was shot dead using a G3 rifle, raising questions about how poachers gained access to the highly guarded premium park.
