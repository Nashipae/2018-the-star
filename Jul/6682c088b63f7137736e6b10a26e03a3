Standard Chartered Bank has taken on Central Bank over proceeds of Treasury bonds registered to collapsed Tsavo Securities and valued at Sh50 million saying they should be shared. The bank intends to cash in on the bonds to recover Sh31 million from Tsavo Securities. But Standard Chartered holds that it loaned Tsavo Securities Sh40 million, with the bonds used as security for the transaction. Standard Chartered is in possession of the bonds, and wants to the High Court to allow it recover its dues in full. The lender has however not specified how much the collapsed bond holder owes it inclusive of interest. CBK said Standard Chartered’s debt is Sh47.4 million. High Court judge Francis Tuiyott has now given Standard Chartered the go ahead to sell the disputed Treasury bonds at competitive market rates, as he attempts to get the two sides to reach an amicable settlement. “The only sticky issue is the amount to be recovered by Standard Chartered. CBK asserts that this is Sh47,424,806.94 while the Standard Chartered’s position is that its debt should be settled fully but does not give the extent of that indebtedness. This really is the only outstanding issue and I have to take a view that a pragmatic approach is to first attempt an amicable resolution from the parties.” “I direct that counsel for the parties appear before me on a date I shall shortly appoint with substantive instructions on this narrow question. I shall in that session attempt to have the parties agree,” Justice Tuiyott ruled. Tsavo Securities was in 2014 blacklisted by the Capital Markets Authority after investigations revealed the firm had fraudulently acquired Treasury bonds worth Sh39.5 million and cashed in on the papers. CBK then sought to recover the amount lost from Tsavo Securities and its owner Fred Mweni.
