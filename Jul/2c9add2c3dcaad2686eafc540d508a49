Nyandarua woman representative Faith Gitau (pictured) has called for the reintroduction of corporal punishment in schools. She said caning will reduce cases of unrest, which she blamed on poor parenting. “Corporal punishment should be brought back to schools because indiscipline is becoming too much,” Gitau said. She spoke at Ngai Ndeithia Secondary in Ndaragwa, Nyandarua, where she issued bursary cheques to needy students. Some Sh2 million was issued to 1,500 orphans in schools across Nyandarua under the National Government Affirmative Action Fund. The legislator condemned the rate of indiscipline, saying students have become unruly and are even assaulting teachers as well as committing offences such as burning schools and destroying property. Gitau said the riots, which mostly occur during the exam periods, are well planned and executed. She accused students not ready for exams of being behind the unrest. Gitau said such students should be prosecuted and jailed for others to learn from their experience and avoid destroying school property. Click here for the latest political news
