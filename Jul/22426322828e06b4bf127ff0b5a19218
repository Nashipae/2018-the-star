Deputy President William Ruto visits Western today on a “purely developmental” mission. His visit comes amid speculations of rifts in Jubilee. Party secretary general Raphael Tuju dismissed the claims. Malava MP Malulu Injendi yesterday said, “The DP’s visit will be purely developmental. He will be fulfilling part of the pledges he made during the last election campaigns.” Kakamega county commissioner said the DP will be in Malava subcounty to deliver a bus to Tande Secondary School. He will travel to Mumias West to launch tarmacking of the Mumias-Sidindi road. Ruto will proceed to Bumula subcounty in Bungoma county to launch construction of Kimwanga Subcounty Hospital, before presenting another bus to Kimatuni Salvation Army Special School. Tarmacking of the Lurambi-Nambacha-Musikoma and Shianda-Nambacha roads was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta and the DP in the run-up to last year’s election but it has not started. “As local leaders, there are issues we shall put on the table for him to respond to,” Injendi said. He however said they will not raise the problems in the sugar industry with the DP as relevant agencies are already investigating. Ruto is said to have his eyes on the Western vote bloc for his 2022 presidential bid. He has come under sharp focus over his countrywide tours. He recently defended himself, saying he is discharging his national duties. His allies have been accused of engaging in premature campaigns and distracting the President from his Big Four agenda. Ruto has however requested politicians to focus on development and shun 2022 election politics.
