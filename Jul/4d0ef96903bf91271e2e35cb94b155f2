Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has appointed seven executives who will not be vetted after the county assembly failed to approve them within 21 days. Mutua invoked Section 9 of the Public Appointments Act which stipulates that upon expiry of the period for consideration specified in Section 8, the candidate shall be deemed to have been approved. The new CECs are Evelyn Mutie (Energy), Morris Aluanga (Transport), Titus Nzeki (Administration), Francis Mwaka (Trade), Kimeu Mbithi (Public Service), Urbanus Musyoka (Agriculture) and Lazarus Wambua (Education). Mutua read out the names on yesterday outside his Machakos office at a press conference attended by Deputy Governor Francis Maliti. The governor said the Machakos assembly has been hostile to the executive and his decision was made in the best interest of the people. “I swore to protect the Constitution and uphold the rule of law at all times in my duties,” Mutua said. After his re-election, Mutua nominated an initial five CECs and submitted their names for vetting by the county assembly. But the assembly rejected the five nominees on grounds of political bias rather than legal requirements, the governor said. He added that he held consultations with the assembly leadership and implored them on the need to set structures that spur development. “These consultations led me to appoint three ministers from my outgoing Cabinet and nominating seven others for vetting ,”Mutua said. The list was sent to the assembly on May 21. The nominees were vetted from June 11. But debate on the report was halted by a succesful motion seeking stoppage of any discussion. On June 12, Machakos MCAs passed a vote declaring the governor’s seat vacant following the court’s annulment of Mutua’s election. The Court of Appeal said the county boss was not validly elected and voided the results declared by the IEBC.
