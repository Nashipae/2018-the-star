China has maintained that the trade balance with Kenya is favourable for both countries and will continue to leverage of the opportunities in the business environment for investment.  Chinese Embassy's economic and commercial affairs counsellor, Guo Ce said they will encourage increased Chinese investment in the country especially in agriculture, manufacturing and health care sectors.  According to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, the value of imports from China in 2017 reached Sh390 billion, a 20 per cent jump from Sh337 billion in 2016. This is against the total imports of Sh1.7 trillion during the year. “Many people are worried about the approach of Chinese governments when working with African countries. Even at some point foreign investors were making their investments in China, but now most of all those companies are owned by Chinese people. We will continue to work with Kenya providing our traditional financial services,” Ce said last Friday.  China has also renewed push for the signing of free trade agreement (FTA) as they continue funding infrastructural projects in the country.  China has been negotiating for FTA with Kenya and East Africa Community since 2016. Trade PS Chris Kiptoo however in May declined the call with the inclination to protect local growing manufacturing industries.  Ce has said the China International Import Expo to be held in Shanghai in November 2018 will give Kenya chance to showcase its products such as tea and coffee.  Accoding to China ambassador to Kenya, Baohong Sun, Africa including Kenya is in need of 9 billion dollars investment in infrastructure, which is the reason China sees there is need to engage with other countries to finance those projects.  “Kenya and Africa is need of funding. China is filing the gaps and also facilitating capacity build up and transfer of skills to Kenya labour market,”
