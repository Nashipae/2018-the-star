Kenya’s Hellen Obiri and Ethiopia’s Genzebe Dibaba will renew their rivalry in the 5000m at Rabat Diamond League on July 13.Dibaba, the world 5,000m record holder and Olympic silver medallist over the distance, is also the fifth fastest of all-time at 5000m with a 14:15.41 personal best from 2015.Obiri is the Olympic silver medallist and world champion at 5000m, whose 14:18.37 life-time best from 2017, ranks her eighth fastest of all time.Their career paths have crossed twice over the distance, first at Rome’s Golden Gala Diamond League fixture last year, the race in which Obiri produced her lifetime best, taking the victory with Dibaba finishing a distant sixth. Dibaba returned the favour earlier this season, winning in Eugene in 14:26.89, with Obiri a well-beaten third, nearly ten seconds behind.The meeting record belongs to 2016 double Olympic Champion Almaz Ayana, who clocked 14:16.31 in 2016, the sixth fastest performance of all-time. Obiri has had a mixed season on the Diamond League this year, finishing 14th at the season opener in Doha and third at the Prefontaine Classic. In Doha, she clocked 8:53.65 in the 3,000m race while in Eugene, she posted 14:35.03 to finish third. Obiri said the meeting in Rabat will be ideal preparation for the Africa Championship in Nigeria in August, where she wants to win her first gold in the 12-lap race having won the 1500m title in Marrakesh in 2014. “It’s the only title I have not won on the African continent and I am confident with my preparation, I can win,” added Obiri. Elsewhere, high-powered clashes will dominate the Lausanne Diamond League meeting today. The women’s 100m is expected to be explosive pitting world 100m and 200m silver medallist Marie-Josee Ta Lou against 2016 Rio Olympics 100 and 200m champion Elaine Thompson, and double world 200m champion Dafne Schippers of The Netherlands, who will be seeking to earn a third consecutive European 100m title in Berlin next month.Ta Lou, who leads this year’s world 100m rankings with a personal best of 10.85sec, had a rare off day in Paris, finishing third in the 200m in 22.50. Lausanne offers her an opportunity to state her credentials as a future champion. For Thompson and Schippers, meanwhile, this will be a perfect opportunity to get under 11 seconds this season.
