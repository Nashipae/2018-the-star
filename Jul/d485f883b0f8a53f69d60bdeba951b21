Busia Governor Ojaamong and three of his cabinet members have denied seven counts of fraud and will stay in police cells until Friday. They were remanded by Anti-corruption Court Magistrate Douglas Ogoti to the EACC police station pending a ruling on their release on bail. Ojaamong’s lawyer James Orengo had wanted the magistrate to give them temporary freedom but Ogoti opted for a "wholesome and reasonable ruling". The prosecution is opposed to the release of the suspects and wants them denied freedom until the case is finalised. Ojaamong and several other are charged with engaging in a scheme to defraud the county government of Sh8 million between the months of March and September 2014. A charge sheet lists seven counts ranging from abuse of office, conspiracy to commit an economic crime and engaging in a project without proper planning. The suspects are also facing a count of willful failure to comply with the law relating to the management of public funds and fraudulent acquisition of public property. Other suspects are county executive committee members Bernard Yaite, Timon Otieno, Leonard Wanda, Allan Ekweny and Samuel Ombui.
