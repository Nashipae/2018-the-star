The government has ordered a sugar milling company in Kwale to drain one of its dams as it is structurally unsound, posing danger to residents. Kwale Sugar International Company Limited has been given one week to empty Mkurumdzi dam, currently holding 2.3 million cubic litres of water, or face action. Water Resources Management Authority officials inspected four of the firm’s seven dams yesterday. Engineer Ahmed Mbarak said the dam has been leaking, causing panic among residents. He said the dam was built illegally. “The company went ahead to build the dam without a permit and even after applying for one, it is yet to be issued because there are conditions it has not met,” Mbarak said. He said the dam is structurally weak and was leaking and can lead to destruction of life and property. Mbarak said the authority will be forced to drain the dam after the expiry of the notice and take action against the firm.

The dams, plus 30 boreholes, have a capacity of 20 million cubic litres of water. Of this, 80 per cent is used for irrigation while the rest goes into sugar milling and processing operations. But company community relations manager Mathias Mutua denied any wrongdoing. He said only one side of the dam’s wall is leaking and it poses no serious threat. “It is a minor leakage and fortunately there are no people downstream; and even if it was to get worse, the water will drain straight into the Indian Ocean,” Mutua said. The Warma officials disconnected water supply to the company over an outstanding Sh200,000 bill. Click here for the latest political news
