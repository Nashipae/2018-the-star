A father fears his daughters may be among the 17 victims who died in the Gikomba fire last Friday. Isaiah Isabia learnt of the news on TV. One of the girls is 14 and the other eight years old. Isabia saw his former wife speak about the fire in the news on TV. The tragedy has rekindled a three-year family dispute. Isabia was married to Beatrice Kaveke for seven years. The union crumbled in 2015.

I was able to trace her and took our eldest daughter,” Isaiah said at Chiromo Mortuary yesterday. Initially, they each had custody of one daughter. However, in December last year, Beatrice got custody of both girls. That was the last time Isabia saw his children. “I want [to see] my children to pay my last respects and to bury them. The woman [Beatrice] has not been picking my calls and she is not even talking to me right now,” Isabia said. “I don’t know if both kids are dead or there is any who survived I just need answers.” The chairperson of human anatomy at the University of Nairobi, Peter Gachangi, said the 17 bodies have been received at the mortuary. He said the government is expected to identity them by the end of this month. The family of Geofferey Mungai was yesterday hoping to identify their son David Abdalla, who they last saw five months ago. The family of Caroline Wanjiku, 18, aslo hopes to identify her body.
