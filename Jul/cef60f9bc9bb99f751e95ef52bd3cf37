Kariobangi Sewage Treatment plant has been temporarily closed for rehabilitation and will be re-opened at the end of August. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko said in Kariobangi the broken trunk of sewer had flooded houses leading to the closure. He said all sewage in the city has been diverted to Dandora Estate Sewage Treatment Works. Fifty per cent of sewage in Nairobi drains in the plant. The sewer line begins from the central business district via Eastleigh to Kariobangi.

Sonko said the burst sewer was constructed in 1958 and was not meant for a large population. The governor said the county should not be blamed, but the developers who have built structures on the sewer lines. Sonko called for an audit of all properties built on sewer lines. He told the owners to remove them voluntarily or they would be demolished. He raised concern over claims by a private developer that he owns the title deed of land where the treatment plant stands. "We are going to demolish structures in order to expand the sewer line,"Sonko said. Sonko said on July, 24 at around 4pm the trunk of sewer was blocked at Kariobangi Light Industries, leading to a spillage.

The governor said on both occasions, it was established that the blockage was caused by garbage that had been dumped into the trunks. "We urge the individuals dumping garbage to desist from the illegal acts for the sake of all Nairobians,"he added. Click here for the latest political stories
