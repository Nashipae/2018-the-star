Meru community will support Deputy President William Ruto on condition that he picks former Meru governor Peter Munya to deputise him in 2022, Tigania East MP Gichunge Kabeabea has said. Kabeabea said, Munya (current EAC Cabinet Secretary) is equal to the task and his development initiatives as MP and governor have shown how capable he is to hold a bigger political seat. "In 2022, we will support him for 2022 but on condition, he picks Munya to be his deputy. We want Munya as his Deputy because Meru community has never had a higher national leadership post of that calibre," Kabeabea said at Mukuiru Secondary School on Friday when he issued Sh 400,000 to reconstruct three dormitories that were razed down recent.

"I deduct marks from Gideon Moi being President, first he is weak politically, unpopular, he does not know the real needs of common Mwananchi. Raila and Gideon have however not declared that they will contest the presidency in 2022. He (Gideon) has never set foot to an interior village or kiosk, so, how will he know the challenges Mwananchi face? I have done inquiries on a likely leadership of Raila Odinga as a President but realized he is old, retiring with President Kenyatta." He downplayed allegations that there disunity in the Jubilee Party saying it's a Media created and daylight propaganda.
