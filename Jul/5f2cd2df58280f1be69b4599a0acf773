 Five woman representatives want more punitive measures to end the outlawed female genital mutilation, which is still practised by some communities. Statistics show regions that practise FGM lead in maternal deaths. The Kenya Demographic
Health Survey shows FGM prevalence in Northeastern stands at 97 per cent. The woman reps addressed the press in Garissa. They said despite FGM being outlawed and attracting stiff penalties, some communities are still defiant. They were Rehema Hassan (Tana River), Beatrice Nkatha (Tharaka Nithi), Catherine
Wambilianga (Bungoma), Rosa Buyu (Kisumu), Irene Kasalu (Kitui) and Halima
Mucheke (nominated). Kenya outlawed FGM in 2011, but it is still being practised secretly. The law forbids derogatory remarks against women who have not been cut. Offenders risk jail, fines or
both. Nkatha said girls are still under
threat from the harmful practice. She said women MPs are pushing for tough sentences for those who subject their girls to the cut. “It is unfortunate that in the 21st
century, we still talk about FGM when we should be [discussing]
issues that change lives like education,” Nkatha said. Kasalu urged parents to fight FGM with the help of administrators. “We have parents who instead of discouraging
FGM abate it. They expose their daughters to [serious] health implications,” she said.  Rehema said only women who have undergone FGM know the complications during child birth.  “This is a culture that we should all say no and save our women from imminent deaths," Rehema said.  Two weeks ago, Garissa woman rep Annab Gure had blamed the elders and local administrators for being on embracing the vice instead of ending.
