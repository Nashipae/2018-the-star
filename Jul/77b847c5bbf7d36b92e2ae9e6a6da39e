Meru MCAs have passed a Sh10.26 billion budget. Budget and Appropriations committee chairman Julius Mbijiwe yesterday said they allocated Sh90 million for building ECDE classrooms and Sh420 million for roads. Meru Youth Service — Governor Kiraitu Murungi’s signature project — got Sh100 million. Akithi MCA Victor Karithi said the budget aligns well with Murungi’s manifesto. “It touches on lives of the ordinary mwananchi. We have significant allocation to water and irrigation — drilling boreholes and empowering avocado and macadamia farmers,” he said. Karithi said the executive should implement all the development projects included in the budget. “To whom much is given, much is expected. We want the executive to give the people the much they deserve. We’ll be very vigilant. The projects must be a success,” he said. Karithi said the Controller of Budget should approve the funds early so residents enjoy quality services. The MCAs had deducted Sh91 million from the governor’s office, Sh176 million from the Finance docket and Sh10 million from the Public Service and Environment departments. They also scrapped a Sh101.4 million dairy tender.
