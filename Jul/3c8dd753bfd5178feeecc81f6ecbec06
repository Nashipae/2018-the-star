A Kitui pastor accused of defiling and impregnating a Standard Seven pupil was yesterday chased out of the area by residents. The pastor, who operates a church in the county, is said to have been teaching schoolchildren “adult lessons”. Residents said on Sunday, while addressing his congregation, he insulted local men. “I have earned myself fame in the past few days, meaning I’m the only standing man in this area,” he allegedly said. Residents said the pastor told them they will be dying one after the other for accusing him of defiling schoolchildren. A resident said they ejected the “son of God” from the village “as this serves him right”. “The pastor has to leave our community now for we cannot continue living with a rapist in the name of serving God,” the resident said. His wife said this is the third location they have been evicted from and wondered where they would go to next as the family’s name has been tainted. Police rescued the preacher from the mob.
