People found guilty of defiling or raping children or women should be castrated, Isiolo senator Fatuma Dullo has proposed. She raised concerns about the rising cases of defilement and rape of schoolgoing children. Speaking at Isiolo Stadium during an education day, the senator said, “It’s unfortunate that as we speak here, a agirl aged seven and a 20-year-old are recovering in hospital following separate rape ordeals. I will do everything possible, including consulting Fida to ensure culprits are brought to book victims get justice.’’ Dullo urged residents to shun outdated practices including early marriage.
