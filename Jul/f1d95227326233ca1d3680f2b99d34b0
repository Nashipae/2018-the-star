Two people were on Monday taken to a Kigumo court to face the charge of assaulting a journalist. Peter Irungu and Joseph Otieno were accused of assaulting Dennis Kabiru - a Royal Media Services cameraman. The latter was on duty at Elite Girls Academy in Maragua town on July 20 when he was reportedly assaulted. Irungu and Otieno also faced charges of theft and causing malicious damage to the journalist's camera. They denied the charges before senior resident magistrate Agnes Mwangi and were released on Sh70,000 bond each. The magistrate scheduled the case for mention on August 6 and hearing October 28. Kabiru, together with two others, were covering parents who were protesting a Sh3,000 fine levied on their children. The learners were charged after they walked out of the school two weeks ago. "We were talking to the parents when suddenly, a group of youths charged at us. My colleagues ran to safety," Kabiru said. Kabiru recorded a statement at Maragua police station and was treated for minor injuries at Maragua sub-district hospital. The police arrested Elite Group of schools director Elisha Ndung'u last Friday and released him on a Sh10,000 police bond. He was ordered to appear in court on Wednesday.
