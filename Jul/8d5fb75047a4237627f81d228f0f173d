MPs yesterday adopted the report on the Ruaraka land at the centre of a row between two city public schools. A private firm is seeking Sh3.2 billion for it.The report was passed with an amendment that exonerated the EACC and that it be involved in investigations of the matter. The report drafted by the National Assembly Committee on Lands. The committee had recommended that the anti-corruption agency takes responsibility for the irregular acquisition of the land. But last Thursday evening, chairperson and Kitui South MP Rachel Nyamai moved an amendment to exonerate the EACC from blame . Kikuyu lawmaker Kimani Ichung’wa backed her, arguing that EACC had done its part and should be supported to complete its work.
