Exhibitors were left counting loses following low turn up during the Baringo County Agricultural Show in Kabarnet town. The three-day trade fair started on Thursday and was expected to close on Saturday. Most participants were school children and police officers who marched and sang for guests. “I had high expectations to meet, educate and sell our products to farmers yet only 30 showed up,” said Francis Barongi. Barongi is an agricultural expert from Juango Agro-Chemicals. Governor Stanley Kiptis did not attend because he was on a trip abroad.
