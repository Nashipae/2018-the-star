monsters need on a summer vacation? A whole lot of sunscreen! Since Dracula is
resolved on giving all his guests at his Hotel Transylvania a good vacation, he
hardly has time to leave the hotel, let alone take a vacation. His daughter
Mavis announces that the whole family needs to take a vacation together, so she
surprises them with a monster cruise. The cruise is run by human captain
Ericka. Dracula is captivated by Ericka. Although he feels ashamed at what the
others — his daughter especially — would think of him being in love with a
human. Ericka turns out to be the
great-granddaughter of Abraham Van Helsing, a famous monster hunter who has
been trying to kill Dracula for many years! Van Helsing has mechanised himself
to avoid death as he wants to kill Dracula before he dies. So he uses Ericka to get to Dracula. But his plan fails when Ericka
falls in love with Dracula, too. The simplistic plot with slapstick humour
is characteristic of any Adam Sandler film. He simplifies the story to make
room for a good time. Being familiar with Sandler’s production, one can always
be ready to meet his expectation. The film is nothing short of a 90-minute
goofy distraction. And at the core of it lies the simple message that Sandler
has been trying to bring across in all three films: our differences don’t and
shouldn’t define the relationships we have, because underneath it all, we are all
pretty much the same.  Star rating: 3/5 stars
