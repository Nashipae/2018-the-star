NASA leader Raila Odinga has said corruption, if not tackled, will lead the country in the wrong direction. He said his decision to join President Uhuru Kenyatta was for the sake of peace and to end corruption. “When I was attacking the government about corruption, most of the leaders said I was making noise, but finally the truth came out,” the Opposition chief said. Raila added that corruption is almost making the country bankrupt. “It is just the beginning of the fight against the deadly monster,” he said. Raila spoke in Kijauri, Nyansiongo ward, Nyamira, at the funeral of George Ndemo, who died on June 11. He was the son of Governor John Nyagarama. Siaya Senator James Orengo told off Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen over his remarks that the former Prime Minister is involved in the ongoing Mau eviction. He said it was irresponsible for Murkomen to make reckless statements which have no basis. “Raila is not in his league. He is a global icon that his boss [Deputy President William] Ruto cannot march,” Orengo said. His sentiments were echoed by Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang who cautioned Murkomen and Rift Valley leaders against baseless remarks that can cause tension and unnecessary anxiety. Kajwang added that Murkomen should be clear on whether he is in government, or the opposition. “You cannot be everywhere,” he said. National Assembly Minority Whip Junet Mohammed said the handshake was the best thing for Kenya as it bought unity. “The trip to Canaan is still on course. Initially, we had a road that was bumpy and it led us nowhere. But now, we have picked on a new road that has the masses and we are sure of getting to Canaan,” Junet said. Those present included Chief Justice David Maraga and Kisii Governor James Ongwae. Read:Our resolve with Uhuru to end graft unstoppable - Raila Click here for the latest political news
