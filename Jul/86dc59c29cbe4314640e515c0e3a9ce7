President Uhuru Kenyatta has asked the National Lands Commission to revoke the allocation of the Kibarani dumpsite land. He said that the dumpsite be transformed into a recreational site in line with the Mombasa regeneration project. This followed after his meeting with Mombasa Governor
Ali Hassan Joho, Cabinet Secretaries Najib Balala (Tourism)
and Keriako Tobiko (Environment). According to minutes of the meeting, the president also agreed to Joho's request for a city regeneration
intervention modelled on the Nairobi Regeneration Programme. Earlier, National Assembly's Environment committee had visited the dumpsite for probe into claims of land grabbing. The MPs had stopped reclamation of the Indian Ocean at areas bordering the dumpsite following the claims.

Mombasa Cement, which is doing the reclamation, was also summoned to appear before the committee. But Uhuru
directed the Muhammad Swazuri-led commission to hand the land back to the county government of Mombasa. The president also directed that the dumpsite be decommissioned and the land
be used for the development of recreational facilities. He said this will be as part of the
ongoing efforts to reposition Mombasa as a top tourism destination. The president said his directive is in line with the Big 4 development agenda in
which he seeks to improve the lives of Kenyans by boosting wealth and
employment creation.
