Four people died yesterday at Iten County Referral Hospital after an accident on the Iten-Kabarnet road, Elgeyo Marakwet. A 14-seater matatu rolled several times after it was hit from behind by a car near a bend in Kolool. A witness said the Prado Land Cruiser was speeding. Elgeyo Marakwet Health executive Kiprono Chepkok said three passengers suffered serious head injuries and were referred to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Edoret. The other occupants of the matatu sustained cuts and fractures but were in stable condition, he said. The driver and passengers of the saloon car came through unscathed. "We ask motorists plying this route to be more careful because the road meanders through a hill and has many sharp corners," Keiyo North police boss Mwenda Meme.
