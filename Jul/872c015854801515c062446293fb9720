World U-20 10,000 metres champion Rhonex Kipruto will be hoping to star at the Birell Prague Grand Prix after writing history in Tampere, Finland earlier this month. Kipruto said he is eying a win in the 10km race to be staged in the Czech Republic in September 8. The US All-comers 10K record holder won gold in the men’s 10,000m in 27:21.08, beating Uganda’s Jacob Kiplimo (27:40.36) and Ethiopia’s Berihu Aregawi (27:48.41) to second and third places respectively with another Kenyan Solomon Boit placing fourth in 27:57.44. An epic battle is expected in the 23rd edition of the race in September as Kipruto says he is determined to dethrone race record holder, Bernard Kimeli. Kimeli and Kipruto also competed in Prague last year and the former won. After World U20, my next stop is Prague 10K race. I know the competition will be tough and I preparing hard,” Kipruto said in Iten. In 2017, Bernard Kimeli and Mathew Kimeli battled it out right to the end and with a time of 27:10, Bernard was the first to cross the finish line, breaking a new personal best and race record. Kipruto (27:13), whose excellent result took everyone by surprise, settled for third place. A total of eight men managed to finish the race in under 28 minutes including the Norwegian Sondre Nordstad Moen who wrote his 27:55 personal best and the best European time recorded in 2017. It was also all smiles for race record holder Joyceline Jepkosgei who smashed her own world record, chipping away 21 seconds off her previous record. She clocked 29:43.= Kenya’s Fancy Chemutai emerged second after crossing the finish line 30:06 ahead of Bahrain’s Violah Jepchumba who clocked 30:25 to take the third position. Joyceline is yet to confirm her defence for the Prague title with 44 days to the race.
