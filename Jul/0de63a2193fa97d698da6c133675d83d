Police in Mombasa are looking for a woman who stole a 2-months-old boy outside Coast Provincial General Hospital on Tuesday. County commander Johnston Ipara on Sunday said Fatuma Yahya lost her son, Yahya Shebe, to a kidnapper only identified as Mariam. Ipara told the Star on the phone that the suspect is known for begging outside the hospital. "Fatuma was duped by Miriam to take baby clothes to a purported kin inside the hospital in exchange for Sh2,000," Ipara said. The kidnapper asked to remain with Shebe and Fatuma agreed. "When I returned, she was gone and the baby was missing," the woman told journalists at the police station on Sunday. The distraught mother said she interacted with Mariam for only an hour after they met a the corridors of CPGH. Fatuma said the woman was in a company of two men and claimed to be visiting a kin who had undergone a Caesarean procedure. The kidnapper requested to be taken to Mackinon market to buy the said clothes, of which Fatuma offered to help with the hope of getting some cash. Fatuma said she exchanged contacts with the kidnapper, who all along carried her son, but the phone was switched off when she sought to take back her baby. Ipara warned members of the public to be on the lookout for child traffickers. "We believe that we will soon get the child. We are working with police at the border and all over the Coast region," Ipara said. Click here for the latest political news
