A company wants Kenya Airport Authority chief executive officer Jonny Anderson jailed for six months for allegedly allowing the pulling down of an advertisement billboard despite a court order. Backlite Ltd argues the court had issued orders stopping the pulling down of its billboard at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport but KAA allowed their continued removal even after being served with a court order. “We rushed to JKIA and served KAA with the court order on June 21, but even after that, the removal and vandalism of the billboard continued and by evening that day, another billboard had been pulled down in contempt of the status quo order,” Backlite said. In a replying affidavit filed in court, the authority said no sufficient reasons have been produced to justify why KAA’s chief executive should be jailed for contempt. KAA said the application by Backlite should not be allowed and it does not have any contractual obligation with Backlite. “Any contract that Backlite can claim it has, had a time frame which if at all enforceable, should not be extended beyond its term by issuance of any injunctive orders,” KAA says in court papers. Backlite says KAA’s action in authorising the continued removal of the billboards by another firm, despite the court order, is a clear indication and intent to frustrate the order and resolution of the dispute, which seeks to protect the billboards. The case will be heard on July 17.
