Kenyan champions Gor Mahia progressed to the semis of the ongoing Cecafa Kagame Cup after defeating Vipers from Uganda 2-1. Identical 2-2 draws against Rayon Sports of Rwanda and a 2-0 win against Port of Djibouti had given the Dylan Kerr led side rights to progress to the quarters. K’Ogalo could not find their footing in the first fifteen minutes, and it was no surprise when they fell behind courtesy of a Lwanga Tadeo strike. The Green Army defense was caught napping, failing to shut Nsefuka Rahmat, who did well to find his teammate. George Odhiambo, new boy Francis Mustapha and Jacques Tuyisenge had half chances to get the Kenyan side into level terms in the first half but they failed to take them. Two minutes after the break, it was one all; this time round Tuyisenge managing to hit the right button for the sixteen-time Kenyan Premier League champions. With about fifteen minutes left, Mustapha made amends for his misses by firing in what turned out to be the winner. Gor had a commanding game beating surprisingly strong AS Sports of Djibouti 2-0 in Dar es Salaam on Thursday but the Kenyans needed a brand new Fifa rule to be declared Group ‘B’ winners of the ongoing Cecafa Kagame Cup. In the ongoing Fifa World Cup in Russia, African representatives Senegal were denied a place in the last 16 of the tournament after a ‘dead-heat’ tie for qualification with Japan who got the slot because they had a better disciplinary record (less caution cards). Gor Mahia and Rayon Sports of Rwanda finished their Kagame Cup group stages each with five points and identical statistics on any method that would have broken the stalemate. But Gor with four yellow cards, one less than Rayon, were declared winners of the group.
