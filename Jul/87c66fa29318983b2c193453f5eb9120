Kirinyaga Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri says the criminals who hijacked him and forced him to undress in April are threatening him with dire consequence if he does not give them money. Speaking at Wanguru DC offices in Mwea during a public baraza, Ndambiri said he is living in fear of the gang. "The government should deal with these criminals conclusively, if they can intimidate a deputy governor, what about an ordinary person, I have told them to come and face me,’’he said. He added ‘as you know I was filmed while naked by criminals and forced to confess on many embarrassing things at gunpoint,’’ he said.

"I escaped death by a whisker, it's only through God grace that I am alive and I can speak to you and explain what happened that fateful day’’ he said as amused residents cheered him. "I’m a victim and I can be in a better position to tell you that these criminals don’t need any mercy. They are supposed to be killed,’ he said. Central regional coordinator Wilson Njega said police will ensure those terrorizing residents in the area are dealt with ruthlessly. The regional commissioner accused some politicians of protecting criminals and bailing them out any time they are arrested. "I’m very disturbed by the actions of some of our leaders they have become gatekeepers for the criminals any time police arrest these criminals they are very quick to call the police to plead for their release we can’t allow these,’’ he said. Last week a gang raided a bar at Ndindiruku village and killed a business lady and her employee. ‘’We want to know the source of these guns because we fear some criminal elements in the police service may be hireling guns to criminals top terrorize residents,’’ he said.
