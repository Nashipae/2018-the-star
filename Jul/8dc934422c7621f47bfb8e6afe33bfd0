Six former MPs have been shortlisted for the position of member of Parliamentary Service Commission. They are Samuel Chepkong’a (Ainabkoi), Ali Farah (Mandera East), Lati Lelelit (Samburu West), Protus Akuja (Loima), Elias Mbau and Stephen Karani Wachira (Laikipia West). They will compete for the slot reserved for a male in the PSC. Former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo and former Clerk of the National Assembly Justin Bundi did not make the shortlist. According to Article 127(d) of the Constitution, the PSC consists of among others “one man and one woman appointed by Parliament from among persons who are experienced in public affairs, but are not members of Parliament”. Both Farah and Bundi had applied and were shortlisted in the Jubilee Party nominees for the East Africa Legislative Assembly. However, they were unsuccessful during the voting stage. The six will be interviewed on Thursday next week and Clerk of the Senate Jeremiah Nyegeye, who is also the CEO of the PSC, has asked them to get certificate of good conduct from the DCI. They are also required to get cleared by the Credit Reference Bureau, High Education Loans Board, EACC, KRA and have a recent letter from a professional association. Whoever will be picked by the interviewing panel will join Justin Muturi, Naomi Shaban, Beth Mugo, Adan Keynan, Benson Momanyi George Khaniri, Aisha Jumwa, Aaron Cheruiyot and Lorna Mumelo.
