Two MPs from Nandi have accused some of their colleagues of trying to blackmail President Uhuru Kenyatta in the anti-corruption fight. They are Vincent Tuwei (Mosop) and Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills). They said an attempt to link Uhuru’s brother Muhoho to import of duty-free sugar was a diversionary tactic. Tuwei hit out at his Aldai counterpart Cornelly Serem saying he ridiculed members of the Kalenjin community by linking  Muhoho before getting his facts right. “The claims were unfortunate coming from our own MP trying to push to malign the First Family using a fake document,” Tuwei said. He spoke at Tomnet AIC in Mosop constituency on Sunday during a service to dedicate the construction of the building. Tuwei said contrary to the public view that the majority of Rift Valley MPs were opposed to the lifestyle audit, he supported it. “This runaway corruption must ended. Those opposing it and trying to backdate the exercise were guilty because they could not explain the sudden riches they have,” he said. Keter said a lifestyle audit should be carried out for all leaders both at the national and county level. He said property  suspected to have been bought with the proceeds of corruption should be seized by the state. Read: Uhuru now goes after tender officers in graft war Click here for
