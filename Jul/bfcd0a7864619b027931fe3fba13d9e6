The go-downs of Kwale International Sugar Company Limited will remain closed until investigations are complete, Coast region DCI coordinator Joseph Ng’ang’a has said. The state closed the stores where 102,940 bags of 50kgs sugar were found. Samples of the sugar were taken to the Government Chemist for testing. Ng’ang’a, said  a multi-agency team visited the company after suspicions were raised that the sugar might be contraband. "The company is under probe by the government to establish if the sugar is fit for human consumption," Ng’ang’a said. The firm's community relations manager Mathias Mutua yesterday declined to comment on the matter. Mutua said he would brief the media once investigations were complete.
