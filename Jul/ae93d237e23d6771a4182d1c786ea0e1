Nominated MP Geoffrey Osotsi has vowed to continue working with ODM leader Raila Odinga. He spoke at Osogo ACK Church on Sunday during a funds drive hosted by area MP Mark Nyamita. Osotsi is embroiled in a leadership wrangle over the ANC secretary generalâ€™s post with publisher Barrack Muluka. ANC members have branded him as a rebel for working with Orange Democratic Movement leaders. "People ask why I am in ANC, but I walk a lot with ODM leaders. My answer is we are all in NASA," he said.
