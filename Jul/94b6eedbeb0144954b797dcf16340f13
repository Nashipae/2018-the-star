Fear has engulfed Chawia,Teri and Susu areas of Mwatate in Taita Taveta after a pride of marauding lions invaded the area. The Lions believed to have escaped from the expansive Tsavo National Park have killed close to 70 livestock in less than a week. Residents said the wild animals have been killing cows, goats, sheep and donkeys every day. "Yesterday I was awoken by the distress of a bleating donkey. I armed myself with a spear and a torch and to my surprise when I got out of my house I found three lions which had mauled 1 cattle,1 donkey and 2 sheep in the animal boma. I scared off the lions with wailing sounds and they disappeared with the second cow," Ronald Righa Mwamba a resident of Kibarani village said. On Sunday, there was fear at Murray Girls School after a report on social media that the lions had been spotted entering a forest neighbouring the school. However, Taita Taveta Deputy Governor Majala Mlagui visited the school to calm down the students. "Last night after being chased by the KWS Rangers in Teri (Chawia), the Lions found their way to Susu and injured a young calf. The homestead is on the cliff side overlooking Murray Girls High School separated by thick bush and steep terrain. The lions were seen escaping into this bush and the KWS Rangers are currently on patrol in the area." she said. Mwatate legislator Andrew Mwadime called upon the Government and Kenya Wild Life Service to make sure that wild animals are returned in the National Park. He said recent attacks in Bura and Mwakitau had negatively affected livestock farmers. George Nagwala, KWS assistant director in charge of Tsavo conservation area, said they had not confirmed whether the attacks were from a lion. Click here for the latest political news
