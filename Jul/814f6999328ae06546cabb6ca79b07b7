A man who defiled a neighbour’s nine-year-old daughter will serve a life sentence after he lost an appeal. Dennis Mutindi, a caretaker, was convicted by Machakos Judge Charles Kariuki. On August 2, 2016, Mutindi defiled the child in Machakos. Eric Kasiamani, a clinical officer at Kilungu Subcounty Hospital, said a post rape care form showed the child had been defiled.

A urinalysis test done was positive,” Kasiamani said. The child, testifying in the case, identified Mutindi as her attacker. She said she was sent by her mother to get a matchbox from the accused. When she got to his house, he told the girl to remove her clothes. The girl reported the incident to her mother, who took her to Mutungu hospital and later reported to Salama police station. She said she screamed, but Mutindi covered her mouth. He told the girl to tell her mother they had gone to buy chips, if she enquires on her whereabouts. Mutindi had denied the charges, saying the public wrongfully beat him up and accused him of raping the girl.
