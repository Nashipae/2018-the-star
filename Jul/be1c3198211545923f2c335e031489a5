Homa Bay county commissioner Irungu Macharia has urged Bunge la Wananchi to work with security teams to fight social ills. He said they need to eradicate hooliganism, early marriage, teenage pregnancy and HIV-Aids. “This outfit should use the concept of Bunge to discuss matters that drag Homa Bay behind. It is high time members began focusing on the myriad challenges we face as a society,” Macharia said. He addressed members of the outfit on Thursday in Posta Grounds, Homa Bay town (pictured). Macharia was with county police commander Marius Tum and DCI Daniel Wachira.  He banned night discos, blaming them for teen pregnancies, early marriage and the spread of HIV-Aids. “The ongoing crackdown on illicit brews will be extended to disco matangas because those are the places where hooligans [hide],” Macharia said. Tum and Wachira said their doors are always open to wananchi. Speaker Walter Opiyo said they will rotate the Bunge forums in all eight constituencies and collect residents’ views on development matters.
