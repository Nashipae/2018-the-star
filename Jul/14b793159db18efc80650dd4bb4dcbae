Patients in Mandera are praising two Cuban doctors posted to the county referral hospital a month ago. Those from Mandera and neighbouring Somalia who spoke to the Star yesterday said they are getting better services than before. Amina Mohamed successfully delivered through a caesarean section performed by Landhi Rodriguez. She said residents are flocking to the hospital due to the presence of the Cuban doctors. “You will be surprised that many patients especially from the villages are now coming to the county referral hospital for treatment, thanks to the presence of the Cuban doctors. We have faith in them,” she said. Mohamed said the only challenge is the language barrier. Some crucial patient information is lost during translation, she said. Another patient, Halima Yussuf, who has had five miscarriages in a row was optimistic she will get help from the Cuban doctors. “I just can’t carry any pregnancy to term,” she said. “My efforts to get assistance from local doctors have failed. I hope and pray that under the supervision of the Cuban doctors I will be able to carry my pregnancy to full term, deliver safely and cuddle my baby like other mothers.” Doctors Herrera Correa and Rodriguez said they are committed to treat their patients. Rodriguez said initially they were wary about security. “At first I was very reluctant to come over here with my colleague but changed my mind after a lot of persuasion. I am comfortable with the security arrangements,” he said. Kenya imported 100 doctors from Cuba who arrived in June. The government says they came to fill gaps in the public health sector.
