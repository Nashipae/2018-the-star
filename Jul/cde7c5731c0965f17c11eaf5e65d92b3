The Federation of Women Lawyers wants teachers at Moi Girls and their union officials probed afresh for attempting to derail rape investigations. On June 2, the Star broke the story of rape at the school. The school board was dissolved and the principal quit. Police are investigating the case. They have collected DNA samples from 32 men. The Government Chemist was to release the results on July 2, but asked for a one-week extension. On Wednesday, the Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers released a report published in one of the dailies. It alleged the incident was an assault by a lesbian colleague. “Before investigations are concluded, Kuppet and teachers at the school gave their verdict. We want to know who the union is trying to shield and why,” Fida chairperson Josephine Monga’re said. “No person wants to go through all those tests and take medication if they were not raped. Kuppet is trying to criminalise the student and humiliate her so that she runs away. We will not accept that. We will stand by her all the way,” she said. A source familiar with the investigations told the Star there was no way they could subject 32 men to DNA sampling if at all there was no evidence to show there was rape at the school. Separately, political activists Brian Weke and Kibera Laini Saba MCA Cecilia Ayot said they were disappointed in Kuppet. Weke is a parent at the school and Ayot is among those behind protests to push for swift action. “It is the first time we are hearing about the issue of lesbianism in the school. When the matter was reported, witnesses said they spotted a man in the compound,” Weke said. Ayot said Kuppet was being mischievous. She vowed to take  the union to task over the report.
