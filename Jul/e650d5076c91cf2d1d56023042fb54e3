Director of Public Health and Sanitation Kepha Ombacho has praised Nairobi governor Mike Sonko’s announcement that all public toilets will be free of charge. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Ombacho said the governor’s move is a good idea but only if the toilets are kept clean and safe. “The toilets must be acceptable to the user as they will be 100 per cent accessible to all people but the county must take full responsibility to ensure they are clean and thugs will not attack people inside,” he said. Ombacho said security must be vetted because some workers might vandalise items. He urged the governor to build sewer lines in slums. “The biggest challenge in informal settlements is clean water and toilets which contribute to diseases like cholera. The county should move in and provide communal sanitary facilities in slums and remove waste material to a central place,” Ombacho said. He praised banks that have built toilets for customers and urged all businesses to follow suit quickly. Ombacho said he had received complaints some shopping malls charged customers between Sh10 and Sh20 to use toilets and condemned the act. Last month, Sonko announced Nairobi residents would soon start to use public toilets for free.
