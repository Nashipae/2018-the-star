The crisis in NASA deepened yesterday after ODM threatened to deny affiliate parties a share of the political parties fund. The threat means Wiper, ANC and Ford Kenya risk losing millions from the kitty. ODM, led by Raila Odinga, warned the coalition partners could lose out on the fund if they continued feuding. Party secretary general Edwin Sifuna told they will be forced to resort to drastic measures, including denying the three parties a share of the funds.” “We have been giving our [ODM’s] share of the political parties fund to our partners based on a gentleman’s agreement. We are actually not bound to give them anything. It is out of the party’s generosity,” Sifuna said.
