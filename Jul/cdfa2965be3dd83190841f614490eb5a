The NYS suspects, who have been unable to post bail, can now breathe easy after a judge agreed to reduce stringent terms set in June. Justice Hedwig Ong’undi reduced the bail terms, following an application by four junior NYS officers, who have been in remand since their arrest in May. In the revised ruling, the suspects will pay Sh2.5 million bond and a surety of Sh500,000 to secure their release. In addition, they will also pay Sh250,000 bail. The judge had in June placed stringent bond terms, requiring all the 55 suspects to each post Sh5 million bond with a surety of Sh2 million. The suspects were also required to deposit Sh1 million bail. Among those who will benefit from the revised terms are storekeepers at NYS and others said to have been sent to collect foodstuff from the Mechanical Transport Branch (MTB) stores. “Having considered the nature of the charges facing the applicants, their financial capabilities drawn from their payslips and letters of employment, I’m of the considered view that they have convinced me of the need to review the bail imposed,” Ong’udi ruled Four members of the Ngirita family have been unable to secure their freedom. Ann Wanjiku and her siblings Phyllis Njeri, Jeremiah Gichini and his wife Catherine Wanjiku who are said to have received millions from NYS are still in remand. Their lawyer Cliff Ombetta once unsuccessfully pleaded with chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti to reduce their bail terms. Then, Ombeta told court the family cannot raise a total of Sh5 million bail, because most of their accounts and assets have been frozen. Their mother, Lucy Wambui, is the only member of the family who after several attempts managed to secure her freedom early this month.
