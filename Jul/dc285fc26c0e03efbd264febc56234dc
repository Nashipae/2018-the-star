Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to give residents from the county state jobs. He said Nyandarua gave the President the highest number of votes and it would be good for him to return the favour. "Our work should not be only mobilising people to come out and vote in large numbers. We need to be rewarded," Kimemia said. He spoke at Catholic grounds in Ol Kalou during celebrations for the International Day for Cooperatives. Kimemia thanked the President for appointing Nakuru Health executive Dr Jonah Manjari as the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority CEO. He comes from Kinangop in Nyandarua. "We also have Health CS Sicily Kariuki who comes from Nyandarua. But there are many other jobs we want our children to get," he said. Kimemia said the President, who declared himself as Nyandarua governor number one during a campaign rally at Shamata prior to repeat elections in October last year, is doing a lot for the county. The governor said Nyandarua has people who are well educated and they deserve positions. He said," That is why I plead with you Mr President to remember this county and appoint them to key positions."
