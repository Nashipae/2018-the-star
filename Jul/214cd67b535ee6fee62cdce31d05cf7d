The conduct of the MPs in and out of Parliament became a subject of debate in the House yesterday.Majority leader Aden Duale kicked off the storm when he rose on a point of order to raise concern about a new trend where MPs hold press conferences to demean their colleagues and malign the work of the committees they sit in.He said some MPs have developed a bad habit of attending committee meetings as friends of the committee, especially when a witness appearing is from their communities.

You can imagine a judge hugging a criminal. A committee of the House has similar powers like those of the High Court,” Duale said.Minority leader John Mbadi said the move is compromising the integrity of Parliament, when MPs are seen to be siding or protecting those appearing before committees. “When you go there you are supposed to safeguard the interests of the House. When I watched my colleagues in the joint sitting of Trade and Agriculture, the co-chairman Kanini Kega was losing it. State officers must conduct themselves in a manner that avoids conflict or demean their offices,” he said.Mbadi warned that MPs mentioned adversely in interfering with the functions of the committees will be removed.Speaker Justin Muturi said MPs who fail to attend committee meetings with no reason will also be axed.Those who only show up and sign attendance sheet before disappearing will also be dealt with, he said.“If you think you are not able to serve in a particular committee inform the leadership, don’t become a friend of the team merely because a person from your village is appearing to give information. They are not suspects. The committees are engines of this House,” Muturi said. More: Jubilee MPs go to court after 'irrational' removal from committees Click here for
