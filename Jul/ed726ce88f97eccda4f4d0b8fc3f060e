Two form three girls from Ngarariga girls secondary in Limuru who went missing one month ago have been found in Malindi. The two Maria Waithera and Purity Wanjiru were allegedly ‘rescued’ by boys and offered a place to stay in Maweni slums after the person who had promised them jobs disappeared. They are being profiled by DCIO officers on the circumstances which led to their escape from school and travel to Malindi without informing their parents. Malindi OCPD Matawa Muchangi confirmed that the girls were at the Police station and promised to give a briefing later in the afternoon. “It’s true the girls have been found we are profiling them to know how they came to Malindi,’’ he said. Two women who rescued them and reported to the police said the girls were staying in Maweni in the outskirts of Malindi town. Florence Tatu Kazungu, a single mother of two told journalists that they reported to the police after watching news of the missing girls last evening.
