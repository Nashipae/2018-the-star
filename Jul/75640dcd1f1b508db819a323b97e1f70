The government has issued 11,800 title deeds to residents of Suba North in Homa Bay to end land disputes. Residents of Usao, Ngodhe, Kamreri, Kasgunga, Kayanja, Wasaki and Waondo received the documents after waiting for 50 years. Some elderly people said they first sent applications for titles in the 1970s. Homa Bay lands registry official Calvine Oguma on Friday said 40,000 title deeds remain uncollected. He said delay in issuing the titles had been caused by financial challenges. “Some residents said they can’t raise transport cost to the lands office to collect title deeds,” Oguma said. Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo (pictured) said the titles will hasten economic growth. “Land is a factor of production. It has been difficult for residents to develop when they are landless,” Odhiambo said. Click here for
