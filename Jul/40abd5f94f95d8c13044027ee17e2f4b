Knut will call a nationwide teachers strike on September 1 if the Teachers Service Commission fails to drop policies “hurting” teachers, secretary general Wilson Sossion said yesterday. He said the policies, which include appraisal for teachers and delocalisation are being implemented without consulting teachers through the union. The unionist said implementation of the policies, which he termed “dictatorial and improperly negotiated” have hurt the morale of teachers. “The claim by TSC that the policies are contained in the CBA is false. We are ready to challenge it with the proper legal and human resource evidence,” Sossion said. He spoke in Njoro, Nakuru, during the burial of former Nakuru Knut executive secretary Njau Kuria.
