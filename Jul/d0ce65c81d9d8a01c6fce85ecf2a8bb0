Defending champions Azam FC bundled Gor Mahia out of the ongoing Kagame Cup in a pulsating 120 minutes semi final clash at the National Stadium, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The match, a repeat of the 2015 final where Azam beat Gor 2-0, was headed for a penalty shootout after a barren draw in the regular time but Ditriam Nchimbi and Bruce Kangwa struck in the 92nd and 100th minutes of the extra time to deny Gor a spot in the final. The pre-match rituals was marred by controversy as Gor declined to use the dressing room reserved for them claiming their rivals had placed black magic paraphernalia. Influential midfielder Francis Kahata, who is rumoured to be following Meddie Kagere’s footsteps to Tanzanian league champions Simba, was mysteriously omitted from the starting 11, fueling more speculation on his exit despite reports that he sat out due to a slight knee knock. Dependable holding midfielder Ernest Wendo also missed the clash with an ankle injury picked against Vipers in the quarters. Quarter finals hero and new signing Francis Mustafa, who partnered Jacques Tuyisenge against Vipers FC was relegated to the bench for Bernard Ondiek, as head coach Dylan Kerr reverted to using speedy wingers — Ondiek and George Odhiambo on the right and left respectively. With Kahata absent, Kerr paired Humphrey Mieno and Philemon Otieno in the central midfield while Harun Shakava led a four-man defence alongside Innocent Wafula, Charles Momanyi and Godfrey Walusimbi with Boniface Oluoch in goal. The two sides struggled to break the deadlock in regular time, credit going to the goalkeepers who produced superb saves to keep their sides in the match. However, it was Gor who blinked first in extra time allowing in quick goals which sent their opponents to their second successive final. Gor last won the Cup in 1985, beating arch-rivals AFC Leopards 2-0 in Sudan, their third trophy since the tournament’s inception.
