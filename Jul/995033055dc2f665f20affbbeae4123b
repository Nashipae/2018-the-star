A top National Intelligence Service officer is the new Immigration boss. Alex Muteshi who was in charge of counter terrorism at NIS will fill the post left by Maj Gen (Rtd) Gordon Kihalangwa who was promoted to Principal Secretary in the same State department. Muteshi will take charge of a key department that controls entry and approves permits for foreigners. He is remembered for telling the 12th Parliament after the 2017 General Election to be careful with what they share with diplomats. “They are intelligence officers,” Muteshi was quoted as saying.
