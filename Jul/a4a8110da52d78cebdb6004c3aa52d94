Newcomers headline boys volleyball semi finals set for today in the ongoing Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association Term Two Games at Hill School, Eldoret. Kapkenyeloi (Rift Valley), Shimoni (Coast) and Mogonga PAG who locked out the 2017 winners Sengera SDA in the Nyanza Region finals have all made the cut to the semis in their first year of featuring in the national showpiece. Kapkenyeloi, who topped Pool ‘A’ will come face-to-face with Mogonga PAG in the first semis, whil Pool ‘B’ will see leaders Malava Boys entertain Shimoni in the second tie. Kapkenyeloi sealed their unbeaten run with a 3-0 (25-11 25-20, 25-21) victory over Lang’ata High as former champions Malava maintained their winning ways, beating Gatunga 3-0 (25-8, 2514, 25-18). Mogonga finished second to Malava after defeating a stubborn Karega 3-0 (26-24, 25-18, 25-16). On the other hand, Shimoni outwitted North Eastern’s Furaha 3-0 (25-19, 25- 11, 25-19). Malava Boys’ setter Elvis Kimutai said the assignment ahead of them is not easy but will keenly stick to coach Shadrack Tovoko’s instructions as they seek to reach final. “We have had it smooth in the past three days and we are now at the most crucial stage of the competitions. We have to execute our well thought out moves in the offence and be very keen in defence. Shimoni may be an underdog but they are equally a good team,” averred Kimtai Girls’ national and East Africa defending champions Kwanthanze face a lethal debutants Bishop Sulumeti in the semis as Soweto Academy lock horns with Cheptil. On their way to the semis, Kwanthanze won all their matches, wraping up preliminaries with a 3-0 (25-14, 25-19, 25-14) win over former champions Tetu Girls. Bishop Sulumeti eased past St. John’s Kaloleni 3-0 (25-22, 25-14, 25-17) as Soweto Academy had an easy 3-0 (25-4, 25-3, 25-3) win over Makoror in their last group match. Cheptil, on the other hand, were pushed to the wall by newbies Nyakach Girls before escaping with a 3-2 (20-25, 25-17, 25-21, 16-25, 15-8) win. Cheptil captain Benedine Chepng’etich intimated that they are ready to confront Soweto and that they will not leave anything to chance. “We are ready for the semis and very focused on advancing to the finals. We picked valuable lessons from Kwanthanze on Day One and we’ll definitely up our game at this level,” noted Chepng’etich. The finals will be played tomorrow with all the top three teams in the girls category booking tickets to the East Africa Games. The boys category will only see the finalists book tickets to the Rwanda show.
