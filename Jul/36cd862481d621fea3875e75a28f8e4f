Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) have released selection criteria for the national Sevensâ€™ team for the next two seasons. In a statement, KRU said the move will set a clear cut pathway that will ensure the identification and selection of players to the Sevens World Series and ensure the national team meet their targets.To be selected, one will have to feature in at least three of the six legs of the local circuit before the World Series. He must also be over 18 years and attached to a local club. A list of pre-selected players will be availed to the technical bench three months before the world series kicks off. This will be followed by trials or contract review based on performance the past season, or both. From this stage, the short listed players will have to turn out for training regularly and will only make the cut based on positions, after attending 90% of training.This does not end there as medical condition of a player, discipline and criminal records will also count. According to KRU, correct conditioning will be applied to further fine tune final selection. The size and weight of the player will equally be key in the final selection. Forwards must scale above 90kgs while inside and outside backs must be at least 75kgs and 85kgs respectively.Positions are now up for grabs in the national sevens team following the conclusion of the 2018-2019 World Series and World Cup held last week in San Francisco, USA. A 40-man squad is expected to be named at the end of the circuit.
