Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry national chairman Kiprono Kittony (pictured) wants the boda boda sector regulated to ensure order on the roads. He said on Friday the sector has the potential to transform many lives and must not be left in ruins. Kittony called for compliance with safety measures to prevent accidents. “Since January this year, 1,100 boda boda riders and their clients have lost their lives on the roads,” Kittony said when closing the Vihiga County Investment Conference. He praised the KNCCI Vihiga chapter for planning to buy buses for boda boda saccos. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa urged the counties to invest in regional economic blocs to benefit from larger markets. “Among our top national priorities is forming regional economic blocs. As we sell Vihiga county as a hotbed of entrepreneurship and a one-stop shop for investors, one stands to benefit more from bigger economic blocs than being alone,” Kittony said.
