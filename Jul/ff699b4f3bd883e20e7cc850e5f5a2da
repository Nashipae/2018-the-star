Religious and political leaders have been asked to join the fight against FGM in Samburu. Anti-FGM board chief executive Bernadet Loloju yesterday said parents should protect their children from harmful practices such early marriage, child labour and FGM, which force them out of school. Loloju said there are laws to punish those practising the cut. “If you subject your child to FGM you will be arrested, charged and jailed,” she said. She said the anti-FGM campaigns have been intensified across the country. “We have a bill at the East African Legislative Assembly on anti-FGM across the borders,” she said. The CEO said guidelines will soon be released to guide anti-FGM dialogues.
