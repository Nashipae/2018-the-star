Embu parents and teachers have called for reintroduction of corporal punishment in schools to tame unrest. Kenya Parents Association Embu chapter chairman Njiru Kathangu and Kenya National Union of Teachers Embu branch executive secretary Josphat Kathangu said children have become big-headed and disobedient since caning was outlawed. Kathangu told the Star in Embu town children have become unruly because they know they are protected by the law and won’t be punished. They act with impunity, riot and destroy property, he said. Kathangu — also a member of the Consolata Goreti Kyieni Girls High School’s board of Management — corporal punishment is not meant to humiliate or injure children but to correct them. “The centuries-old saying ‘spare the rod and spoil the child’ has taken a heavy toll in Kenya after the cane was spared by enacting the law. The children are spoilt,” he said. Kathumi backed the return of corporal punishment. He said children must be disciplined. He also blamed “arbitrary transfer of headteachers” for the wave of unrest across the country.
