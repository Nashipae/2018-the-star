Kiambu MCAs’ women caucus has launched a programme to help needy families as a way of giving back to society. Speaking at Kanunga village yesterday, Kiambu MCAs women’s caucus chairperson Muongi Nduta urged residents to support the less fortunate to promote harmony and togetherness. "We need to care and respond to the needs of one another. As MCAs, we have decided to lead from the front," Nduta said. The nominated MCA led the caucus during a visit to the home of elderly couple Paul Mwangi and Margaret Mukuhi. Mwangi and Mukuhi are over 85 years old. The MCAs donated food, clothes and cash. They promised to help the couple’s granddaughter Ann Mukuhi get a job to help the family. Lucy Kogi said the caucus will ensure the assembly passes laws that promote the welfare and rights of marginalised groups. They promised to visit more poor families.
