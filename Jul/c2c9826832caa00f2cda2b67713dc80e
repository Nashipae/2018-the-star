Bura MP Ali Wario has commended the National Assembly for rejecting the preliminary findings of a joint committee probing contraband sugar. He said it was a sign of maturity by lawmakers. The MP spoke in Bura town on Saturday. “People have a perception that Parliament must approve what is brought to the floor of the House. The work of MPs’ is not to rubber-stamp what the executive wants,” Wario said. On Thursday last week, National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale and his Minority counterpart John Mbadi led MPs in rejecting the findings of the committee. They rejected a recommendation that the Kenya Bureau of Standards coordinate with other state agencies to ensure raw sugar imported during the duty exemption window be reprocessed by importers. “We expected a definite answer on whether or not mercury was found in the sugar. That report was not conclusive,” Duale said. He said Kenyans do not know what they are consuming, and legitimate importers don’t know the way forward. Co-chairs of the joint House committee Kanini Kega and Mohammed Haji accused Duale and Mbadi of being unfair.
