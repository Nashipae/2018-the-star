Writer John Onyando launched the book The failed quest for electoral justice on Monday at the InterContinental Hotel. The chief guest was Uganda's official opposition leader Kiza Besigye. Also present was former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga, members of political parties and IEBC representatives. “Let Western nations revisit their template on elections and invest in sustainable peace and stability underpinned by justice. There can never be peace and stability without justice,” Besigye said.
