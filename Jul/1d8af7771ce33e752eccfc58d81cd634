Former Kenya Forest Service chief conservator Emilio Mugo has been reinstated by the Employment and Labour Relations Court, pending conclusion of a case he filed against his interdiction. Mugo (pictured) was suspended on March 12 after a tour of Thogoto, Ngong Road, Oloolua and Kibiko forests. This was to pave the way for investigations into the forest sector following a public outcry against destruction. A House Environment committee had questioned how Mugo and other officials were hounded out of office. Senior manager Patrick Nyaga was also sent on compulsory leave. The committee called for their immediate reinstatement, saying the Environment ministry’s action was unprocedural. Following Mugo’s suspension, Monica Kalenda was appointed acting chief conservator. But the court said Mugo must be allowed to access his workstation at KFS headquarters as the chief conservator. The order says Mugo will be entitled to his official car and facilities he enjoyed, and will continue with his normal duties under the contract of engagement between him and the KFS. “Pending the hearing and determination of this application, a conservatory order restrains the respondents, either by themselves, employees, servants or agents, from intimidating, harassing or interfering with the applicant in relation to his official duties,” part of the order issued on July 25 says.
