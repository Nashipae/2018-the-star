Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong yesterday said the waste management deal was above board. He is facing a charge of conspiracy to steal more than Sh20 million from the county coffers. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission said the governor single-sourced a company called Madam R Ltd and gave it a tender. Investigations began in 2016. Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji recommended the governor’s prosecution. Ojaamong said he was ready to defend himself in court. He said there was value for money since the county spent Sh8 million and the company did a good job. Read: DPP approves charges against Busia Governor Ojaamong He told reporters, “No money was lost. This is about politics. I am going to face the President and tell him if they go this way they will lose the fight against graft.” He said it was ironic since the agency previously lost the case at the Court of Appeal. Ojaamong spoke at a hotel in Budalang’i. The governor said the matter is outside the commission’s jurisdiction, adding “the worst that will happen is for police to arrest us”. “We have evidence and paperwork of our legal officers signed with Madam R Limited,” Ojaamong said. The county chief said he neither received communication from Haji’s office nor EACC regarding the charges. He read about it in newspapers and social media. “I have not been officially summoned to record a statement or clarify matters. I am reading all this in the media. Arresting me is not a big issue. Prosecuting the matter to its conclusion is what matters,” he said Ojaamong said the county spent Sh8 million instead of Sh38 million. The county is currently paying about Sh22 million for the same services, he said. He said the disputed amount is “too little”, and it would have been better if he was to surrender it. He wondered why he was being pursued and not the people behind the importation of tonnes of contraband sugar. Click here for the latest political news
