Two death row convicts who exhausted their channels of appeal are challenging the constitutionality of the process used in criminal trials.They are Dickson Munene, a former police officer who was convicted in 2011 for the murder of former assistant minister Patrick Muiruri’s son, and Peter Kariuki. They filed an application asking the High Court to declare unconstitutional a law that allows murder suspects to be tried by the High Court only. The two told Justice Wilfrida Okwany yesterday the law that denies subordinate courts the power to hear and determine murder cases is discriminatory. They argue other criminal offences such as terrorism and robbery with violence, which are serious offences, are tried at the magistrate’s court and a person can appeal at both at the High Court and the Court of Appeal.
