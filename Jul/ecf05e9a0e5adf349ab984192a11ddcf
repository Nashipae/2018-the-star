Bizarre to say but are principals behind the new wave of school fires with
the aim of swindling money from poor parents? The DCI should investigate weird claims
by some parents that there could be some rogue school heads fueling the burning
of schools for selfish gain. Some parents have alleged that principals with an
insatiable appetite for quick money think that by burning schools, they will
force parents to part with colossal amounts of money in the pretext of meeting
the repair costs. After spending a fraction of the collections, they will then pocket
the rest of the cash. Over to you, DCI George Kinoti.  ********** Still on education, Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed may need to move with
speed to unravel the mystery surrounding the elevation of day schools into
boarding institutions without requisite facilities. Corridors of Power is
informed by concerned Kenyans that some schools are operating illegal boarding
facilities despite lurking danger. Some have no dormitories and even adequate toilets,
leave alone a dining hall. Several culprits have been identified in Nyamira county
where stubborn principals, colluding with education officials have approved
such facilities. In such instances education officials levy schools heads some
‘fees’ for operating the boarding facilities. We are told the trend starts by
allowing Form 4s to board ostensibly to boost performance.  ************** Despite what appeared to be a response to the urgency of putting in place an
interim team to take charge of public listed firm Kenya Power, did the board do
any due diligence before picking acting managers? Since Monday evening when
Energy CS Charles Keter named the officials, social media has been abuzz with
claims that some of the new officers do not meet the integrity threshold and
could be among the next targets by the graft investigators. Actually one of the
new managers is said to have offered refuge to a besieged former official, now
being prosecuted. DCI sleuths are said to have picked a senior manager from the
house of one of his colleagues during a swoop on Friday night. Is this a rebuff
in the face of the country when it is just about to witness some real fight
against graft?  **** A female MP has stunned members of the Parliamentary Service Commission with
her rather weird demands. The MP known for her controversial stunts requested
PSC to book her a business class ticket for her flights when the team was
scheduled for a a benchmarking exercise abroad. She argues that the size of her
oversize rear pelvic area requires ample space. Corridors is still going over
the Letter of the Day.
