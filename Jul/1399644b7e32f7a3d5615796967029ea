Kakamega county is facing an acute shortage of doctors, Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said. He received two Cuban doctors posted by the national government in his office yesterday. Oparanya said the county has 104 doctors against the required 250. The county received family doctor Alba Marina and ICU specialist Nilver Gormez. “When devolution came into place, some medics opted to work in their counties, worsening the shortage,” he said. Marina said she is comfortable working in Kenya and hopes to gain more experience by interacting with the community. Oparanya said his government is rehabilitating level four and general hospitals in readiness for the rollout of universal healthcare through the Big Four Agenda. “We will open the first phase of the teaching and referral hospital in October,” he said. The governor added that his government has set aside Sh60 million to enrol vulnerable residents in the NHIF medical cover. Oparanya said the national government will cover those aged 70 and above and counties will cover those aged between 50 and 59 years. He said the county will recruit women, the elderly and the youth, especially boda boda operators, in the programme. Oparanya said the two Cuban doctors will contribute greatly towards the attainment of the universal healthcare. He said the local doctors will exchange experience with the Cubans. “As a county we are ready to embrace universal healthcare by the national government to help our people,” the governor said. “We know the cost of treatment in Kenya is very high. That is why we are embracing the universal healthcare so that our people can access quality services.”
