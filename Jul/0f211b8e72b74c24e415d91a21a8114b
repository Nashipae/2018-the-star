Tanzanian superstar Diamond Platnumz is out here preaching peace to his baby mamas, Zari and Hamisa Mobetto. Despite the fact that the two women don’t see eye to eye, the singer wants them to love each other’s children as their own. Speaking on Wasafi TV, he thanked Zari and Hamisa for taking care of his children, and his wish is to see the kids relate well with each other when they grow up. “I don't want hatred between my children because at the end of the day, we're a family. They are all my children and I love them all," he said. Adding, "Let's not create enmity between the children."
