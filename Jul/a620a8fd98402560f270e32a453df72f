But a wind of political change is blowing across Nyanza following the political ceasefire. Yesterday, acting State House spokesperson Kanze Dena declined to divulge the itinerary of the President even as the national government appeared to be engaging Nyanza residents in preparatory activities. Public Service, Youth and Gender CS Margaret Kobia yesterday kicked off a high-powered tour of the three Nyanza counties of Kisumu, Siaya and Homa Bay. Kobia, in a three-day visit, will disburse cheques from the ministry’s affirmative funds in Kisumu Town East (Kisumu), Kasipul Kabondo (Homa Bay) and Gem (Siaya). Thereafter, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and his Health counterparty Sicily Kariuki will land in the lakeside region to commission a number of programmes this month in preparation for the President’s visit.

The UHC program is part of the government’s agenda for health as one of the Big Four. Kisumu is among the 10 counties selected to run the Sh3 billion universal health coverage pilot phase as part of the national government’s health agenda plan. Under the pilot scheme, Kisumu residents will have access to the NHIF Supa Cover insurance for comprehensive integrated health services. Kisumu Residents Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada said the President is free to visit any part of the country to serve citizens. Last month, Uhuru was set to visit Nyanza for the first time since he won election but it was called off.
