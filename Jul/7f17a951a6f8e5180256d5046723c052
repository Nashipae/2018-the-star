The election petition against Marakwet East MP Bowen Kangogo (pictured) has been taken to the Supreme Court. The Jubilee MP was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. Kangogo’s election on August 8 last year had been nullified by the High Court in March but two weeks ago he was reinstated by a three-judge bench at the Appeal court. Voter Sammy Kemboi, who filed the petition, has moved to the apex court, challenging the decision by appellate judges Erastus Githinji, Hannah Okwengu and Jamila Mohammed to reinstate Kangogo. “Appellant Sammy Kemboi, being dissatisfied with the decision of the judges, intends to appeal to the Supreme Court,” says the appeal notice. Kemboi will file the grounds of appeal and serve the IEBC before the Supreme Court judges set the hearing date. “We have moved to the Supreme Court because we have tangible grounds in law to do so.” Read:Court annuls Marakwet East MP Kangogo Bowen's win At the Court of Appeal, Githinji read the decision of the judges, saying claims of massive irregularities and illegalities during the polls were not proven. Githinji said there was no evidence the results were interfered with. The judges dismissed the findings by High Court judge Kanyi Kimondo that two unregistered polling stations were used. Kangogo defeated former MP Linah Kilimo by 1,000 votes. “We find the petitioner did not discharge the burden of proof of the alleged irregularities, which could have affected the elections,” Githinji said. Kemboi accused the IEBC and returning officer Martin Wekesa of not conducting a free, credible or verifiable election. But Kangogo, in his appeal, urged the court to overturn the decision. The petitioner cited broken seals found inside ballot boxes in Mungwo and two other polling stations. But the appelate court said there was no evidence of tampering.
