County executives have been urged to respond quickly to questions from assembly committees. Nairobi county speaker Beatrice Elachi said executives are slow in responding to requests for statements from House committees. "When an MCA requests a statement, the committee has to, at most times, consult the executive depending on how weighty the statement is. The chairperson of the committee cannot give a response If the executive has not responded," said Elachi. She said feedback from the executives is slow and this delays the county assembly’s work. As of July 12 when the assembly adjourned for a week’s recess, the number of pending statements stood at 35, 21 from the first assembly and 14 from the ongoing second session. Minority whip Peter Imwatok has said chairpersons of committees should be serious with their work. According to the Nairobi City County Assembly Standing Orders, a member may request a statement from the committee chairperson about matters under the mandate of the committee. The procedure also requires the relevant officer to discuss the statement at a a meeting with the committee. Nairobi county, whose Governor is Mike Sonko, has 10 county executive committee members.
