NASA is dead but I will not join Deputy President William Ruto's camp, Bungoma senator Moses Wetangula has said. Wetang'ula said he has his own house (Ford Kenya) and will build it to make it stronger ahead of 2022. "How can I join another camp when I have my own camp?" he posed. Speculations were rife about the possibility of the Bungoma Senator joining Ruto ahead of the 2022 presidential race. However, speaking in Mtwapa, Kilifi on Monday, where he met party members, Wetang'ula said he has been betrayed enough and might be going it alone in 2022.

NASA is history. And those who ignore history run the risk of repeating mistakes," said Wetang'ula. The senator said he and many other Kenyans have suffered massive betrayal by opposition chief Raila Odinga. He said the leader has been fighting for inclusion of all communities in the government but has now been compromised and allowed only three major communities to be appointed to positions in government in last week's reshuffle by President Uhuru. He said Raila has been compromised and joined the gravy train. "That is not the way to go," he said. He said the appointments do not show the face of Kenya. He said Raila has forgotten that Coast, Western and Kisii regions supported him. In March this year, Wetang'ula said he had declared a political war against Raila. He accused Raila of betraying him together with other Nasa leaders; Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka, saying, "we have regrouped to teach you a lesson". There has been a rift within the opposition coalition after Raila Odinga met President Uhuru for dialogue on March 9 without involving them.
