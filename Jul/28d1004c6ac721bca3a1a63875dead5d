The Communications Authority risks losing more than Sh40 million if the appellate court does not suspend a decision by a lower court halting the governmentâ€™s plan to spy on phones. Under a certificate of urgency, the CAK, through lawyer Wambua Kilonzo, wants suspended a decision by High Court judge John Mativo that barred it from installing the monitoring device. The agreement was between CAK and Broadband communications. Wambua said if termination of the deal is not set aside, the authority will lose Sh40.3 million. It will be liable to pay upto Sh209 million, which is the contract price for installing the device. In the wake of increased proliferation of counterfeit devices and theft of mobile phones, CAK created the Device Management System (DMS) to counter the vices. It would ensure only genuine devices access services from licensed mobile phone operators. Before the parameters of the DMS could be agreed upon and before implementation of the said regulatory action could be undertaken, on March 14 last year, a petition was filed challenging the process.
