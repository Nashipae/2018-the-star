Kilifi MCAs want ODM to take disciplinary measures against lawmakers who betrayed the party and supported Jubilee. They said it is wrong for rebel MPs to abandon their party and start campaigning for Deputy President William Ruto. Kakuyuni MCA Nixon Muramba said ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna should discipline the MPs supporting Ruto. He urged the rebels to resign and go for by-elections if they are no longer in ODM. Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa openly declared she would support Ruto. In Kilifi, all elected MPs, senator, woman rep and a majority of the MCAs were elected on the ODM ticket. Muramba said, “Everybody has a mandate to serve the people, even if they shift allegiance.”
