Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has insisted that his decision to allow Nairobi residents access public toilets for free is irreversible. Speaking on Saturday during the launch of the first Nairobi clean exercise under his government at Matopeni, Sonko said he is firm in his decision. Sonko said that a private firm will be contracted to manage the facilities and his Government will cater for the expenses. "My government is capable and will manage all expenses in a contract that will be signed soon," said Sonko. He pointed that cartels have been mismanaging the toilets to an extent of harassing the public. Last week, Sonko announced that Nairobi residents with soon start to use public toilets for free. Nairobi county assembly majority leader Abdi Guyo, however, pleaded with the Governor to include youths and allow them to manage the public facilities. "Let the youth organize themselves in groups from all the 85 wards and allow them to manage these facilities. This will be a way to empower them," said Guyo.
