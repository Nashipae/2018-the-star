Rescuers in Thailand are racing against the weather to free 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. Heavy rains are expected to hit in a matter of days and could see water levels rise, threatening the area where the group has taken refuge. The region of Chiang Rai has for the past few days experienced a brief window of dry weather. Rescuers are now considering how best to bring the group to safety. "We are racing against time before we found them," Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn said at a press conference on Thursday morning. "Now we are racing against water." Narongsak also said telephone lines were being installed in the cave, though they have yet to reach the boys so they can talk to their families. A new phone is being taken into the cave, after a previous device fell into the water and stopped working. Media captionBill Whitehouse from the British Cave Rescue Council explains how the boys and their coach might be rescued If the rain stops for long enough, there is a possibility that the group could walk out of the Tham Luang cave complex, or be floated out - rather than having to dive. The total journey from the cave's entrance to the trapped group currently takes a total of 11 hours - six hours in and five hours back out. Many of the boys can't swim, and all will have to be taught basic diving skills if they are to leave that way. Click here for the latest political news
