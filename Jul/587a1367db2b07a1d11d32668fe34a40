The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is investigating suspected misuse of Sh400 million in Laikipia by the former and current county administrations. Central region anti-corrution manager Charles Rasugu yesterday told journalists in Nanyuki town the probe would focus from 2014 to date. He said among the projects being scrutinised are Ilmotiok Bridge in Mukogodo West ward, Laikipia North constituency. It is said to have consumed Sh128 million yet only Sh35 million was budgeted for it. Rasugu said they are looking into the use of Sh25 million to build pit latrines in 32 Early Childhood Development Education centres. The cost is alleged to have been inflated, with each of the five units per institution said to have been put at Sh800,000. “Members of the public and other stakeholders provided information. After we complete investigations, we will hand over the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions,” Rasugu said. The manager said though the probe is still at an early stage, they are also focusing on a medical insurance cover scheme. Anti-corruption officials will investigate cases of conflict of interest where public officers allegedly awarded themselves tenders or their relatives. “Some of the complaints are already in the Auditor General’s office. Part of the investigation is to find out who was paid, what was it paid for and was it worth it,” Rasugu said. The anti-graft boss is in charge of six counties in the region—Nyeri, Laikipia, Nyandarua, Kirinyaga, Embu and Murang’a.
