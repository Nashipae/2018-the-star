Patients owe Sh500 million to Moi Teaching Referral Hospital in Eldoret. The facility has granted a 50 per cent waiver for those who will clear their bills within the next one month. On Saturday, CEO Wison Aruasa said the bills have accumulated for the past 18 years. He said some patients had been discharged and left behind their ID cards, land titles and other guarantee documents. "This is not the first time we’re giving such a waiver. It’s always for the good of our patients. We know many of them may not pay the full pending bills." Aruasa said. "We’re developing this hospital for the future so it continues to offer the best services to patients."
