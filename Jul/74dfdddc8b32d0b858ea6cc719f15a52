Kuppet was on Friday questioned about the authenticity of the findings that exonerated teachers at Moi Girls School Nairobi following rape allegations. Nairobi MCA Cecilia Achieng’ and Centre for Peace and Reconciliation’s Yusuf Hamnza accused the teachers’ union of “attempting to cover up for their own and defaming the minor who claimed to have been raped” last month. The matter is still under investigations by the DCI.  Achieng said Kuppet should not divert public attention from the matter through findings from what she described as “questionable investigations”. “The DCI has not come out with a formal report on the same nor has there been public communication from the Director of Public Prosecutions on whether there will be criminal culpability on any person,” Achieng said.  But Kuppet secretary general Akelo Misori said those are making such statements are also part of “mob justice lynching teachers’ characters”. He said men teachers are not the only males on the school compound and should not be treated like criminals.
