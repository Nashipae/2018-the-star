Ngara Girls' High School student Saadia Adan, who went
missing late in June, was found in Mombasa on Wednesday. Police said the 16-year-old form one escaped to
the county after her midterm break because she did not want to stay at the school. Adan had been home for 10 days from June 15 when she was taken back to the institution. According to the family, she was escorted to school by her elder sister Halima on June 25 at around 2 pm. She was dropped inside the school by the sister who then left as she was being checked in alongside other students. The school said the student was last seen on June 27 at around 5.30 pm. Adan’s guardian, Ahmed Abdulahi, and her relatives said they visited the school on June 28 but discovered that although the school has installed CCTV cameras, there were none at the point from which she escaped. Addressing the press, Urban OCPD Eliud Monare said the girl was
found roaming the streets. “A good Samaritan took her to the police station. We decided
to take her to the hospital to check on her condition,” Monare said. Fadhia Abdi, the woman who rescued Adan, said she had slept
on the streets for several days. “I saw her at the same point on two successive days. I took
her to my house,” Abdi said, adding the girl claimed she came from Rama,
Wajir. Police said the student had a relative in Mombasa. Click here for the latest political news
