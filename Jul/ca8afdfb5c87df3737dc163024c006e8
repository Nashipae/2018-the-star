A leader from West Pokot has given KenGen a two-week ultimatum to resume operations at Turkwel power station. Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto said if the Kenya Electricity Generating Company Limited fails to heed the call, residents would hold demonstrations. He spoke yesterday at Turkwel Gorge Mixed Secondary School. The MP said peace had returned in the region, and there was no excuse for firm to operate from Kitale. Moroto said since KenGen left over five years ago, residents have been suffering, yet the firm reaps profits. He said the firm provided transport for students. A clinic in the area was closed.
