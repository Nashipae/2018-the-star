Oil mining firm Tullow has so far moved 30,000 barrels ( 4,285metric tons) of oil from Turkana to Kenya Petroleum Oil Refinery in Mombasa since June. The British firm said it moves 600 barrels per day dispatched in four trucks every two days under the Early Oil Pilot Scheme. However, this was below the targeted 2000 barrels per day. The joint venture with National Oil Corporation is undertaking full production after resolving disputes in August with the community seeking jobs, tenders and better share of the revenue. The dispute had led to a two-month suspension on operations. In their Trading Update for the period between July 26 and November 15, the British Oil firm is targeting to make high exploration in East Africa and increase on shareholders’ equity. The firm has now taken the decision to include Twiga field to the two mines Amosing and Ngamia fields, after production and water injection trials in the Foundation Stage Development. “This has been another period of very solid delivery from Tullow against the backdrop of continued volatility in the oil price,” chief executive Paul Mcdade said. The pipeline project and engineering for transportation of crude oil from Lokichar fields, whose design works were announced in May this year, is expected to be completed by March. The cost of the pipeline is estimated at Sh110 billion ($1.1 billion), with a further $2.9 billion (Sh290 billion) needed for upstream operations. "Good progress continues to be made on the Kenya development project. The upstream and pipeline Front End Engineering and Design work is progressing to plan and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2019,” the report stated. They expect to ship the first crude in the first half of 2019.
