Alexandre Lacazette's late goal earned Arsenal a 1-1 draw with Liverpool on Saturday and stopped the visitors moving three points clear at the top of the Premier League table. After a tight first half, Liverpool broke the deadlock in the 61st minute as Sadio Mane crossed from the left and Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno was only able to parry the ball into the path of James Milner who blasted a low shot into the net. Milner was lucky to stay on the field to finish the match after a clash of heads with team mate Joe Gomez which required lengthy treatment. The Gunners, looking to extend their unbeaten run to 14 games in all competitions, poured forward in search of an equaliser and the pressure paid off when Lacazette struck in the 82nd minute. The French striker spun away to the left side of goal to keep the ball out of goalkeeper Alisson's reach before firing a shot past the Brazilian's reach and into the far corner. The draw took Liverpool top of the table by one point from champions Manchester City, who host Southampton on Sunday. Arsenal stayed fourth, although Tottenham Hotspur will have a chance to push them back into fifth when they play away at Wolverhampton Wanderers later on Saturday.
