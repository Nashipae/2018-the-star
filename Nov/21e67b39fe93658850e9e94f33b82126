A former police officer accused of torturing a suspect to death will know his future today. In February, Nahashon Mutua was charged with the murder of Martin Koome who had been arrested for a domestic brawl at his Baba Dogo home. The former Ruaraka station boss pleaded not guilty. The prosecution said the evidence against Mutua was too overwhelming and he should be convicted. Being a trained officer, he should have avoided excessive force, the prosecution said. “There are instances when an officer is allowed to use force, but this case is not one of them,” it said.
