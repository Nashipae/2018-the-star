President Uhuru Kenyatta has been praised for not endorsing a successor for 2022. Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu said this leaves the field open for all aspirants, including Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. He spoke on Friday during the burial of Kalonzo’s father Peter Mairu. Uhuru was present. The President backtracked on his earlier assertion that he would shock the country once he named his choice of a successor. Instead, Uhuru called on all leaders interested in the presidency to campaign in all parts of Kenya and sell their manifestos and policies. He said it was on the basis of the candidates’ policies that Kenyans would make their choice. Others present were William Ruto, Raila Odinga, Musalia Mudavadi and Gideon Moi. On Saturday, Nzengu attended a meeting in Kipkelion, Kericho county, and urged Kalenjins to support Kalonzo’s quest for the presidency. “Kalonzo has the demeanor and virtues needed to occupy the house on the hill and run the country progressively,” he said. “We will escort Kalonzo here to seek your votes when the time comes. I am optimistic that you will give him overwhelming support. You all know very well that he stood with your own, then President (Daniel) Moi and ensured he secured Ukambani votes every election time.” Mwingi Central politician Robert Ngeana said Rift valley would not lose politically if they voted for Kalonzo. “Kambas have a fundamental attachment to the Rift Valley community. That is the reason Kalonzo will give you the position of the deputy president in his government,” he said.
