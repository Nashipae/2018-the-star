Illegal activities in waters shared by countries can only be wiped out if states share assets, Defence CS Raychelle Omamo said yesterday. She said the coordination must be approached with caution as ‘foreign interests’ might interfere. About $1.3 billion (Sh132 billion) is lost each year in Africa through unregulated fishing. “Do we have convergence? Are we prepared to deal with illegal fishing? I do not think so as our interests are different,” Omamo said. Kenya Navy Commander Levi Mghalu said his personnel is not in a position to patrol 240,000 square kilometres of ocean. Omamo said policing coastlines is a hard task due to lack of capacity. “We have limited resources and we need to purchase assets together to surmount challenges,” she said. Madagascar, the fourth biggest island globally, has the longest coastline in Africa. It is located on the eastern side of Mozambique and it covers 587,040 square kilometres. The coastline is 4,828 kilometres long. Somalia’s coastline is second in length at 3,333 kilometres. The third longest coastline is that of South Africa at 2,798 kilometres long. Omamo said there is an urgent need for collaborative and collective initiatives to secure coastlines. She said security experts must not be de-linked from the people. The CS said Kenya’s waters have immense fish stocks, hydrocarbons and other unique species. “Those in the competition may dump toxic waste or even do illegal fishing,” she said. Omamo spoke during the Sustainable Blue Economy Conference. Kenya signed two agreements. In the first, Kenya joined six nations in the Western Indian Ocean on corporation, while dealing with maritime threats. Kenya signed the agreement with Madagascar, Seychelles, Djibouti, France, Somalia and Tanzania. The other agreement is on sharing of maritime information. Click here for the latest political news
