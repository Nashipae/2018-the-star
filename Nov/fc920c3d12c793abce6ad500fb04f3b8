The body of a boda boda rider who went missing last Saturday was discovered dumped in Muguga Forest, Thika East. Residents said Moses Nduati was last seen ferrying two men said to be neighbours, but he did not reach his destination. The attackers stole the new motorbike after smashing Nduati's head with a stone and dumped the body in a pit in the forest. Area MCA Joseph Kahira visited the scene on Friday and gave the authorities one week to arrest the culprits. “If the police will not have brought these culprits to book before the burial date, I will lead residents to capture the suspects because we know them and their hideout,” he said. Kahira cautioned residents not to hide criminals, but instead report them to the authorities. He also asked MP Patrick Wainaina to put up a police post in the area and provide two vehicles for patrol. Nduati's father Peter Ngugi said the family had been searching for their son from Saturday when they were told his body had been found in the forest. He said his son's motorbike was new and had not been fitted with a number plate. Ngugi said the murderers "are known". Residents said crime is rampant in the area, adding that drugs are sold in the forest. However, Thika East police boss Julius Kyumbule denied claims that drugs were being peddled in the forest. He said police have vital leads on the killers who will soon to be arrested. He appealed to locals to remain calm. The body was taken to Thika Level 5 Hospital mortuary.
