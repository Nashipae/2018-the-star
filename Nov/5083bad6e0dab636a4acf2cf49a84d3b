Three people, working for a 'daring private developer', were on Friday arrested for fencing off part of Eldoret State lodge. Additional GSU officers were deployed to guard the facility after the incident. Top police commanders in the region, Eldoret East DC Norbert Komora, and officials from the Uasin Gishu county led the operation. Those arrested said they had been deployed by a former State House Comptroller, who claims to own part of the state lodge land. This comes amid ongoing investigations into how more than 4,000 acres of land belonging to KDF was grabbed at Moi Barracks. Area OCPD Richard Omanga said: "TheÂ matter is still under investigations because those people claim to have documents for the land." "I cannot comment further over the matter but those arrested are helping us with the investigations," the police said. The parcel, about ten acres, is located directly opposite the State lodge and is usually used for parking by State guests. Sources told the Star that the security team, which toured the State lodge land, was surprised to find beacons erected within the protected area. "Those involved must be very daring or well-connected because they have the guts to move in and fence off land in a protected area," a former police boss said. In September 2014, NLC Chairman Muhammad Swazuri led a visit to the State Lodge land to investigate land grabbing claims. The NLC is yet to release the report on its investigations on how land belonging to seven state lodges was grabbed by private developers. Most of the developers claim to have been allocated the land during the regime of retired President Moi. Mombasa, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kisumu, Kakamega, Mtito Andei, and Kitale State lodges are affected.
