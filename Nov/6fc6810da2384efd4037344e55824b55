The administrator said he got a tip-off from locals and immediately mobilised the police who executed the arrest. The form four leavers are in custody at the Bomet police station. The investigators are tracing the person who sold alcohol to the students. "We found bottles of hard drinks in the house and we are still trying to get to the bottom of this to know who exactly aided this act," the chief said. However, area police boss Samson Rukunga said it remains unclear whether all those arrested were students.
