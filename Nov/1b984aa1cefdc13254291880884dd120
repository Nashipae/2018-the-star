More than 3,000 construction sites have defied suspension notices handed to them by the National Construction Authority. The majority are in Nairobi county, and specifically informal settlements, including Huruma, Githurai and Gachie. Public Works PS Paul Maringa on Monday declared a zero-tolerance policy against developers defying suspension notices, adding they will be met with the full force of the law. "The law is very clear on what is needed when it comes to construction. There are agencies enacted to ensure certain criteria are met in order to protect both lives and livelihoods. We cannot allow anyone without necessary approvals and without meeting the set criteria to carry out construction in this country," he said. The PS made the announcement at his office. He said the government will "not compromise on non-compliance with the law". National Building Inspectorate secretary Moses Nyakiongora and NCA acting executive director Maurice Akech were present. Maringa said all copies of suspension notices have been shared with the county government, the police and the DCI.
