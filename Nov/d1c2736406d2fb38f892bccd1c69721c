The Judiciary is the biggest problem in ending corruption, nominated MP Maina Kamanda has said. Kamanda yesterday said corruption in Judiciary was also frustrating the war on hate speech. “The biggest problem we have in Kenya now, even in terms of corruption, is the courts,” Kamanda said. He spoke in Mombasa during a workshop organised by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission to sensitise prosecutors and investigators in the Coast counties of Kwale, Mombasa, Taita Taveta, Kilifi, Tana River and Lamu. Kamanda is the chairman of the National Assembly’s Committee on National Cohesion and Equal Opportunity. He said there were many cases where the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the DPP have rounded up suspects who end up being released after getting bail. “We want to ask the Judiciary to at least live to the expectation of Kenyans,” Kamanda said. The legislator said with corruption in the courts, hate speech will continue to cause divisions among ethnic communities. He said although the NCIC also needs more teeth to deal with hate speech, the courts must do their bit if the vice is to be eradicated. Kamanda said huge gains made in the fight against hate speech have been eroded by graft often involving lawyers and judges. “If we don’t control hate speech in this country, we may end up not having a country,” the MP said. He said his committee was keen on pushing for amendments to the National Cohesion and Integration Act, 2008 to strengthen NCIC. “From what I have heard, that is the area we are going to address,” Kamanda said. The lawmaker asked the commission to identify sections to be amended.
