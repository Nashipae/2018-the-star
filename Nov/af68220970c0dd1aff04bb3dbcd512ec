He struggled and was detained by the colonialists for many years. You cannot say Uhuru is part of a dynasty,” Raila said. The Odingas and Kenyattas are often referred to as political dynasties since they have been part of the country’s political leadership since Independence.

You cannot, therefore, say that Raila is a product of a dynasty,” the ODM leader said.
