Governor Jackson Mandago has banned night discos at funerals and other events in an effort to curb increased teenage pregnancies. He said parties involving school children would not also be allowed in the region. Mandago said Uasin Gishu was greatly affected by pregnancies in schools and the discos, popularly known as ‘disco matanga’, at funerals, would not be allowed. The county boss asked subcounty administrators to team up with the provincial administration and help deal with people engaging in sex abuse of school children. He said governors in the North Rift region were concerned with the increased teen pregancies. “We will not allow situations that may lead to such pregnancies,” said Mandago.
