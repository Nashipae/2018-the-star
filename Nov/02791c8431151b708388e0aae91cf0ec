A KRA assistant regional commissioner based in Eldoret was on Saturday found dead in his house. This was after Francis Nyabuto's neighbours alerted the police of a foul smell from the officer's house. Eldoret East police boss Richard Omanga said it appeared the officer died several days ago. "We are conducting investigations to establish the cause of his death," Omanga said. The body was found covered with a blanket at the Kapsoya estate house. It had no marks of injuries. Police were forced to break through the door as the house was locked from outside. Click here for the latest political news
