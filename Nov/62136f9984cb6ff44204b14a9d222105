Kamande said blood was oozing from his mouth. County commander Farah Mohamed said an autopsy revealed Kanyonyo had died from brain haemorrhage. “The postmortem results revealed that the boy had blunt force trauma in his head that is consistent with assault,” he said. Mohamed said the police are now looking for the people behind the boy’s murder. “We have just started our investigations, we will work with the boy’s family to ensure the culprits are found,” he said. Mohamed warned residents against harassing initiates in the name of tradition, saying it could escalate into assault and death. Residents had expressed concern the boy had been tortured to death in the process of making him transition into adulthood. “We have to know who was talking to him, at what time and why and I know it is only a matter of time before we get the killers,” Mohamed said. Kanyonyo was eulogised as a disciplined and hardworking boy. Gatitu Primary School headteacher Robert Muchara said the boy had been a top performer. Kanyonyo had started a rabbit rearing project in his home that he tended to during his free time. His father died in 2012. Click here for the latest political news
