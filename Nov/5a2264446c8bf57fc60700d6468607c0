We like to talk about the
“sovereignty of the people”â€• title of the very first Article of the
Constitution. Sovereignty is a word loaded with implications. Its very origin is in the idea of
someone being above others. A society that has a sovereign, someone above, also
has those below â€• “subjects”. Again its very origin as a word includes being
“under” something. Maybe the old constitution did not
use the word sovereign, but the reality was that successive presidents had
definitely been “above” the people. Article 1 turns all this on its head by
making those who were subjects sovereigns instead. What makes any person, group or body
really above others? One might identify physical power and wealth as the most
obvious. Control over something else is also crucial: that is information.  AREN’T ELECTIONS ENOUGH? The theory of elections is that the
people choose those who hold power over things such as force and public money,
so that they will use those powers for the benefit of the people.  The weaknesses of this right to choose by
election occur at various points: The people vote for other reasons; those
elected, especially to Parliament, do not understand their role well; they
prioritise their personal benefit and not that of the people; the Executive
succeeds in concealing much that goes on within the wielders of force, and in
the management of money. The Constitution tries to change
this in various ways. There is supposed to be less secrecy
about the military and the police. More power is given to Parliament (though
the same weaknesses of elected representatives arises). For example, the
military are only to be used for some purposes with the approval of Parliament.
And we should remember the provisions about the police promoting “relationships
with broader society”, and their duty to secure national security “in
compliance with the law and with the utmost respect for the rule of law,
democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms”.  They are always to perform their duties with
utmost respect for rule of law, democracy, human rights and fundamental
freedoms. Parliament has far more chance to
influence the way public money is allocated than ever before, and more than in
many countries. Is this a power they exercise for the benefit of the people? Many Kenyans know they are supposed
to be involved in making many policies and decisions. And many have been
involved. But many people will be puzzled by the decisions that have to be
made. Sometimes public participation may be just window-dressing: A façade to
legitimate what those in government would do anyway. All these issues are worth
exploring, and have been. Here we want to stress something that lies at the
heart of all these other supposed methods of shifting power to the people from
those who are supposed to serve them, but all too rarely do.  CONTROL OF INFORMATION Yash Ghai recalls that when he
started studying law at Oxford, he learnt that information held by the state could
not be published except by the government’s consent. This effectively meant that,
however trivial the information, publishing was an offence. The teacher’s example
was disclosure of the menu served at a government canteen. The Official Secrets
Act applied in Kenya too. The 2010 Constitution sought to change
this when it recognised the general principle of the sovereignty of the people.
The Bill of Rights significantly increases the rights of citizens, including
that of dignity.  Article 28 recognises every
person’s inherent dignity, “and to have that dignity respected and protected”.
Article 31 recognises every person’s right to privacy. Article 35 has a slightly different
turn. Its purpose is to facilitate the access of the citizen to the information
held by the state. (It also covers information held by anyone else if “required
for the exercise or protection of any right or fundamental freedom”, but here
we are interested in the state and the citizen). Article 35 ends with another
interesting provision: The State must publish and publicise any important
information affecting the nation. Relations between the state and the
citizen often involve administrative action — as is stated in yet another
Article â€• 47. This says that “Every person has the right to administrative
action that is expeditious, efficient, lawful, reasonable and procedural fair”.
There have been many court cases on that Article, and many decisions made by
public bodies have been held to be wrongly made. We should not forget Article
48: “The State shall ensure access to justice for all persons and if a fee is
required, it shall be reasonable and shall not impede access to justice”. The Constitution forms a whole,
generally coherent, especially when we look at the values of the constitution (including
transparency), at the people’s “sovereign power”, dignity and rights, and
participation.  POWER OF INFORMATION How can the people wield their
sovereign power, whether through elections, participation or any other way if
they do not understand what is going on in government? How can they ensure that
force is responsibly exercised, or resources properly used, if they can never
learn how this is done? So long as government continued to operate as a sort of
black box, of which the people could see only the outside, and understand
little or nothing of the complex mechanisms operating inside (or maybe not so
complex!), there could be no accountability, and no real sovereignty of the
people. The Constitution says that the proceedings
of parliamentary houses must be conducted in an open manner, in public.
Parliament must facilitate public participation in the various business of
parliament. Everyone has the right to petition Parliament to consider any
matter within its authority, including to enact, amend or repeal any laws. Without
the information that comes from open operation of Parliament, these rights to
participate would be meaningless. But more information is needed for
this and other purposes, and Article 35 is central to this. An important aspect
of this is that, like Article 47, it focusses as much on the responsibilities
of the administration, the innermost part of that governmental box, as on the
politicians. Just imagine how much more powerful
all these other constitutional provisions will be if the people can have a
better understanding of government, if they understand how decisions are made,
if they know how much money is supposed to be spent for their benefit, if they
know how much is actually spent. If the media can be better informed, and so
inform the people, if the elected representatives can also know more, the whole
system of democracy, and of administration should operate more effectively.  ARTICLE 35 AND THE ACCESS TO
INFORMATION ACT The effect of these two aspects of
the law is that government institutions of all sorts can be required to supply
information when asked. There are quite a lot of exceptions: Unnecessary
interference with people’s privacy, commercial interests of a company,
obstructing government management of the economy, and far too many provisions
supposedly to protect national security (some of them very vague or even
circular: national security means national security!). But even these
exceptions may be overridden by a court if they would stand in the way of the
public interest being served. The public interest includes that in
accountability of public bodies and oversight of expenditure of public money. The Act goes further and requires
public bodies to give out a lot of information without being asked. It also
requires them to keep their records properly, ensure their accuracy, and
facilitate access to them. The Commission on Administrative
Justice (Ombudsman) is given the role of propelling this whole process,
including by education guidance and hearing appeals from refusal to give
information. We have here a huge can-opener, to
prise open that governmental black box. The implications are little less than
revolutionary. This is a great step away from colonial legacies, and those of
post-colonial oppressors.
