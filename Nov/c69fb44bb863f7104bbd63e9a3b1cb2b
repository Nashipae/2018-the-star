Police in Ijara, Garissa county on Sunday killed one suspected al Shabaab fighter and thwarted an attack at the Rural Border Patrol Unit. The militants, whose exact number remains unknown, struck the camp shortly after 11pm and proceeded to open fire indiscriminately. Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamed Birik said the officers at the camp responded swiftly, killed one of the militants and injured several others. "No officer was injured in the attack," Birik said. "A contingent of security officers are trailing the attackers using blood stains." Birik said efforts to vanquish and eliminate al Shabaab in the region remains on course. A police officer based in the area said the militants wanted to carry out a simultaneous attack on the police camp and a communication mast. Ijara sub-county has borne the brunt of al Shabaab militants due to its proximity to Boni forest and Somalia. A month ago, suspected militants killed two people between Sangailu and Ijara.
