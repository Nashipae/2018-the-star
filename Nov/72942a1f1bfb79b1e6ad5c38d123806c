The Senate has summoned Isiolo governor Mohamed Kuti over a Sh443 million deal entered between his administration and a foreign-owned firm for provision of community health services. Some residents presented a petition to the Senate Health committee, questioning the criteria used to enter the pact, saying there was no public participation. Residents, through Senator Fatuma Dullo, opposed the agreement entered between the county government and Living Goods. The petition says the firm is supposed to offer services in three subcounty hospitals for four years. The committee, which met the petitioners yesterday, promised to address the matter by inviting all stakeholders involved. Committee chairperson Michael Mbito (Trans Nzoia) said they will invite directors of the firm to address the issue. “This is the right place that your issues will be addressed. The governor will appear tomorrow [today] to explain the details of the agreement,” he said. Dullo said the county government had “colluded” with the county assembly to seal the deal. “Due process was not followed and this committee should dig deeper into this issue. Public participation was not done and the Health ministry was not aware of the deal as required by the Constitution,” she said. Dullo said being an essential public service, the county government should have consulted stakeholders, including the general public. Kisumu’s Fred Outa said, “We will do our best as Senate to protect Isiolo county and its people. Public participation is a requirement entailed in the Constitution.” Click here for
