The Nairobi county assembly will begin a crackdown on city clinics operating without licenses. The assembly’s Health committee will next week meet with county health officials, Kenya National Union of Nurses and Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board officials over the matter. The committee’s chairman Peter Warutere said there could be more quack doctors in the city citing the case of Mugo wa Wairimu who this week for the second time was exposed operating an illegal clinic in Kayole.

We want to know who is feeding him because he cannot be operating alone," Warutere said. He called for investigations to reveal who was operating the clinic without a license and how Wairimu received and supplied the drugs. The Kenya National Union of Nurses distanced itself from Wairimu saying that he does not appear in their register.
