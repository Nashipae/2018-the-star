Opposition senators James Orengo (Siaya) and Mutula Kilonzo Jnr (Makueni) accompanied Raila on the visit to Karen. Kalonzo’s father, Peter Mairu, 94, died on Sunday at Nairobi Hospital. “We also know that Mama [Kalonzo’s wife Pauline] has been ailing for a while. We’ve kept her in our prayers. We know she is making progress and pray for her and everybody else at this trying moment,” Raila said.

Gideon said Mairu lived a “long, fruitful and holy life”. “On behalf of my family, the great people of Baringo county, from our party and more importantly from Mzee [retired President Daniel Moi], pole sana to the family,” he said. “Mzee couldn’t come. He’s having a few challenges, but he asked that when you feel strong enough, you could see him so he conveys his condolences to you and to your family.” Click here for the latest political news
