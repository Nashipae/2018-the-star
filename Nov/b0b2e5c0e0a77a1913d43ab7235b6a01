On the face of it, the wrangles in the Homa Bay assembly seem to have abated, apart from the dispute over the speakers’s post. But there’s no relief in sight. MCAs now have promised to turn their sights on the County Executive Committee. The majority, who call themselves Team Sanity have vowed not to stop at the assembly, and will also go ahead and clean the county executive. They accuse the previous assembly leadership of failing to check the executives, which they say has led to underdevelopment. MCA Walter Were (Kanyadoto) said they first want to clean the assembly before they could raise questions over alleged corruption, installed projects and misappropriation of Public funds at the Executives. “We cannot purport to be questioning the executives, yet our House is messed up,” Were said. He said they want to see projects being implemented by benefit the wananchi, saying in the past one year, the assembly has failed in its roles. The team vowed to ensure better roads in their wards, access to water and adequate health services, among other devolved services, are realised before the end of their term. Last week, Justice James Rikareinstated speaker Elizabeth Ayoo after her ejection, and barred MCAs and the County Service Board from appointing any other person until the case is determined. Despite the order, Gwassi North MCA, who was the acting speaker, was elected by 47 MCAs to replace Ayoo. The assembly leadership has reconciled and the Majority leader’s position has been taken by Were, replacing Richard Ogindo (Kanyamwa), who is the Majority chief whip. “We do not want to see a situation where after five years, voters wull be asking what we did while in office. We will ensure the Executives deliver,” Were said.
