Athletics Kenya (AK) western branch have outlined plans to popularise the sport in the region perceived as the bedrock of football and rugby. Branch acting chairman, Patrick Kipsang and secretary general Horma Mugalitsi, said they intend to put up several camps at sub-county level in the region in a bid to bolster talent in the region. He said the branch will also unveil 10 qualified coaches to help in identifying and nurturing talent in various camps that will be set up. “Our core responsibility will be spotting, nurturing, developing and exposing talent with the full support from the federation,” said Mugalitsi. He said the current leadership has already identified Keveye Girls and Kidundu playground as some of the venues that will host the planned camps in Vihiga County. “We already have the blessings of Vihiga County Governor, Wilber Otichillo,” he noted. He called upon the local runners to seize the opportunity as athletics is one of the best paying sport disciplines globally. The secretary general promised to put up good structures that will sustain the program.
