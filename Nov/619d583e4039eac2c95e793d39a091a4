The stalled Nandi governor’s offices building in Kapsabet will not be demolished. Public Works PS Paul Maringa urged the Nandi government to allocate funds in their next budget to complete the project. “This building is strong and sound and as a professor in architecture, I can say the structure is perfect and only needs a few reinforcements,” he said. Maringa toured Nandi county on Saturday to find out the status of stalled government buildings, among them governor’s offices in Kapsabet, subcounty headquarters in Aldai and Tinderet. The PS told engineers from his ministry to help the Nandi government. “As we roll out the construction of houses as specified in the Big Four agenda, we must guard against malicious demolitions,” Maringa said.
