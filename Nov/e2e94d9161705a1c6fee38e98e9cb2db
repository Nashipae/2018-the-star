A Chadian minister has been detained by police following reports that he had married an underage girl. Azzai Mahamat Hassane's lawyer has denied that his client's wife is a minor. French-language news broadcaster RFI quotes a state prosecutor as saying Hassane married the girl in a "customary ceremony" in 2017 when he travelled to the western town of Nokou with a political delegation. Marriage in Chad under the age of 18 is illegal, and people found to have married minors or offered underage children for marriage face prison. Click here for the latest political news
