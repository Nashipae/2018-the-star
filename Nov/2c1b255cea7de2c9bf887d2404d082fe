The Charter Incentive Programme has been extended for another two years, CS Tourism has said. The programme made nearly 18 times revenue for the tourism sector, with government so far spending Sh200 million on the programme since inception. “Moi International Airport, Mombasa is now receiving 15 charter flights per week, up from nine weekly last year. Since the launch of the programme in 2016 to last March, there have been 55,000 arrivals into Mombasa and the surrounding coastal region.The Charter Incentive Programme is working,” Tourism and Wildlife CS Najib Balala said after receiving a charter flight from Netherlands with 120 visitors. The TUI charter flight will be flying twice weekly to Mombasa, bringing about 360 visitors to the Kenyan coast every week. “Moi International Airport is now receiving 15 charter flights per week from nine flights last year. Since 2016 to March this year, there have been 55,000 arrivals into Mombasa and the beach hotels,” Balala said. The arrival of the charter flight comes barely two weeks after the launch of TUI Belgium charter flights into Mombasa last weekend. Netherlands is the fourth largest source market from Europe with 22,108 visitors last year, denoting a growth of 34% since 2016 which recorded 16,489 arrivals. “This is indeed a major boost to the coastal tourism business and contributes to the success of government charter incentives program that has been in place for the last two and half years,” he said. European markets including the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy contribute the highest arrival numbers into coast for the beach product.
