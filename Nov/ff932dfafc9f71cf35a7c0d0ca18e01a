Garissa county secretary Abdi Mohamud yesterday warned ward and subcounty administrators against absenteeism. The administrators are expected to report on the status of projects by the county government. Mohamud spoke when he opened a three-day capacity-building workshop for the administrators at a Garissa hotel. “You are by default the coordinators of the functions of the government at the grassroots level,” he said. Any official who will be absent from his or her work station will face disciplinary action, Mohamud said. Garissa Public Service Board chairperson Ebla Sahal told the administrators to constantly report the needs of the public whom they serve. She urged them to initiate public participation in all the county activities at the grassroots level.
