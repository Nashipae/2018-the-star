Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli led prayers against those behind the maize scandal and asked for God's intervention. The prayer, which was recorded and video widely shared on social media, touched on issues that have shaped the national discourse namely corruption among other scandals. "God I am weak; I do not have power, I can do nothing as I'm also being fought. God save us so that this country changes," he said on Saturday. The Cotu boss was in Eldoret for the 7th graduation ceremony at Nehema Institute, which is run by the Baptist Church. Atwoli went on: "He (God) brought us to a country that is full hyenas and in the jaws of the dogs and He should deliver the country. God touch the heart of President so that he can save us." He said farmers in Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Kakamega and other maize-producing areas are suffering. Atwoli said those stealing from maize farmers come from the same region as them, adding that God should "send your Son and angels to remove those thieves". He also prayed for those behind his woes at the NSSF after being kicked out of the board.
