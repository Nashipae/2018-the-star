The parents of a teenage mother have petitioned the High Court seeking to have Knec set and administer supplementary national examinations for pregnant candidates. Their daughter is sitting KCSE exams after delivering at Mwala Level 4 Hospital on November 3. The parents said the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development should develop age appropriate and comprehensive programmes and curricula on sexual and reproductive health for primary and secondary schools. The girl’s mother, in an affidavit, said she is having a difficult time adjusting. “In the evening after school, she has to clean the baby and the baby’s clothes. She also has to breastfeed her and by the time she is done, she is physically and mentally exhausted,” she said. “She does not have the luxury of studying for the next day’s papers like her classmates.” Click here for the latest political news
