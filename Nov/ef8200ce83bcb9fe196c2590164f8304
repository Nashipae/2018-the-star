The Busia government plans to put up a cross-border fish trans-shipment and wholesale market for Sh36 million by June 30 next year. The one-storey market will be built in Busia town, Agriculture executive Moses Osia told fish traders on Thursday. “Fish trade at the Busia Border Fish Import and Export Market accounts for Sh1.2 billion annually. Fish traders should invest in this money to boost the county's socioeconomic status,” he said. Osia said the money is part of the Sh117 million allocated to the Agriculture department through the Kenya Devolution Support Programme for infrastructure projects. County director of fisheries Timothy Odende said the traders have agreed to relocate until the completion of one of the largest fish markets in East Africa. “The market currently receives about 40 per cent of the total fish landed in Lake Turkana. On completion, the volume of fish traded through the market will increase to more than 60 per cent,” he said. Odende said the plan is to bring all fish handled in Busia under one roof. He said the new market will improve sanitation and provide a better working space. He said the traders operate from mabati structures, which compromises the quality and safety of fish. “Lack of space saw fish exports to the Democratic Republic of Congo handled in three different stores in Busia town,” Odende said. He said the ground floor will have stores and stalls for handling fresh fish. The first floor will have market stalls for dry fish, fish restaurants and eating areas, and offices for market and county government officers in the fisheries department.
