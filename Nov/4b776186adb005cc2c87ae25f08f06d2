Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has urged criminal gangs to return illegal firearms within seven days to receive amnesty. He said on Saturday individuals who heed the call will get jobs and protection. Sonko spoke at Matopeni in Embakasi Central during a fundraiser for Harrison Karanja. Karanja was shot by gangsters in Kayole. His hospital bill has accumulated to Sh6.8 million. Sonko helped raise Sh5.1 million. At the same time, Sonko said the groundbreaking ceremony for 200,000 affordable housing units will be done next week. Sonko said the launch will be done in Pangani. Thereafter, the project will be rolled out in old and new Ngara, Jeevanjee-Bachelors, Ngong Road Inspectorate staff quarters, Uhuru and Suna Road. Sonko said he will not relent in the war against corruption. "No one will live in squalor under my administration and I will not allow corruption to thrive under my watch," he said. Isiolo governor Mohamed Kuti, Makadara MP George Aladwa, Isiolo South MP Abdi Koropu and several Nairobi MCAs attended the fund drive. Click here for the latest political news
