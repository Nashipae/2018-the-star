The Health ministry has recalled Fiesta Stamina and Fiesta Big Black condoms on grounds they are substandard. The Pharmacy and Poisons Board said, in a November 20 letter to Cupid Limited, that the condoms are faulty. "The batch of Fiesta Stamina failed freedom from holes test while that of Fiesta Big Black failed thickness test," the letter signed by Jacinta Wasike said. "You are hereby directed to immediately institute a recall of the affected batch. In addition, submit a recall plan within two days of the receipt of this letter," she said. Condom safety is a concern among many Kenyans, an issue that is likely to feature in this year's World Aids Day celebrations. On Wednesday, a man who sued over a Zoom Condom burst was told that he might have worn the wrong size. The man had sued Beta Healthcare and Kenya Bureaus of Standards over a condom that he said burst during intercourse.
