Meru county plans to process waste to produce fertiliser and other products. It has purchased garbage collection trucks and bins to improve solid waste management. On Tuesday, governor Kiraitu Murungi said the county has put in place measures to support waste processing to create jobs and raise revenue. He said Meru will be a model for other counties. The county will import and process garbage from neighbours. “We want to make Meru the centre of implementation of the urban agenda spearheaded by the UN. Meru town will be beautiful, green, dust-free, and the best in terms of business environment,” he said. The bins will be placed at accessible locations and the trucks will collect them, he said.
