The Nairobi government is mourning the death of Transport chief officer Richard Kavemba.  Kavemba died yesterday at 2.30am. He had been at Nairobi Hospital for almost three months, following stomach complications.  Governor Mike Sonko yesterday morning posted on social media, “It is with a heavy heart and humble acceptance of God’s will that I announce the passing on of Richard Mutinda Kavemba who worked as my chief officer, Transport and Public Works.” Senator Johnson Sakaja described Kavemba as a resourceful, passionate and reasonable man. “I remain with memories of when we worked together since the 2007 campaigns and after, when we would interact socially, when we competed against each other for the Senate nomination and were able to shake hands after,” the senator said. Transport executive Mohammed Dagane said Kavemba was easy to work with and was a hardworking officer. Nairobi County Assembly Committee vice chair Mark Mugambi said he lost a friend and a dedicated servant leader who was always available. “He was a humble man,” he said. Kavemba had been in politics since 2013, when he sought the TNA ticket for the Umoja MCA seat, but lost the nomination to George Mwangi. Last year he contested for Nairobi senator seat in the August elections. He lost to Sakaja. In May, Kavemba was vetted for the Transport chief officer seat. He had been in office only six months.
