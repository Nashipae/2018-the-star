Kisumu MCAs were throwing punches shortly after ODM Raila Odinga lectured the assembly against power wrangles. The fisticuffs were captured on video. MCAs for Migosi Victor Rodgers and Nyalenda A, Jacktone Ogendo fought in a county hotel on Sunday. A video making the rounds on social media shows the two elected leaders at each other’s throats and a third man trying to sepaate them. Most Kisumu residents were disgusted and outraged. “This is very wrong, they just met Raila who read them the riot act and hours later we see videos on social media of the two MCAs engaged in a fight,” residentMark Onyango said. Rodgers said he was attacked by his colleage at the hotel where he was with friends after the meeting with Raila. He told the Star the fight was brought about by a comment he had made a Whatsapp group for lawmakers. “Sometime back I had posted that there was need for unity amongst MCAs and as a family we needed to sit and solve our issues,” he said. “So on Sunday, when our party leader told us the same, I posted to the group, saying those are the things that I have have been talking about,” Rodgers said. He said that Ogendo  immediately commented, “Useless”. “Another member told me to leave him alone because he would beat me. I replied that I was taking a soft drink in the hotel. Immediately, another member told me to get out of  the hotel because he (Ogendo) was coming for me there.” Shortly after the socal media exchange, Rodgers said that Ogendo attacked him from tbehind with a crude weapon. “The video you saw is true, I was trying to defend myself,” the MCA said. When the Star contacted Ogendo, he said he would call back shortly but did not do so. Raila had said assembly wrangles derail development. “We don’t want to see members engage in physical fights,” the ODM boss said. Click here for the latest political news
