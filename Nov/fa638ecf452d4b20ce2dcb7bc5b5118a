A five-storey building at risk of collapsing on Spine Road, Kayole, will be demolished at the weekend if the owner fails to pull it down, City Hall announced yesterday. City Hall is mobilising equipment to demolish the building either on Sunday or Monday. It is located at Bee Centre. “We issued a notice to the owner to stop construction and bring down the extra floors, but he ignored it. The only option we have is to demolish it,” Lands and Housing executive Charles Kerich said. The building is still under construction. The owner was initially authorised to build three floors but put up two extra floors. Yesterday the building caused an uproar on social media, with most people questioning how the county government authorised construction of such a risky building in a populous area like Kayole. A notice dated November 9, and seen by the Star, shows the developer was ordered to demolish the structure. He was also ordered to submit its structural integrity report within seven days. “You are hereby required to stop further construction immediately and submit architectural and structure plant,” the notice reads. The notice elapsed on Wednesday. Several residential buildings have in the past collapsed and killed dozens of people in the city.
