Governors and MPs are uncomfortable with what they call lack of reliable data for developing a new formula to share funds among counties. Governors and MPs discontented with the current formula of sharing the national cake are pressuring the Commission on Revenue Allocation to ensure the third-generation formula takes into consideration the reality on the ground. The current formula expires this financial year. It considers six parameters in sharing funds among county governments. They are county’s population, basic equal share, poverty level, land area, fiscal responsibility and development index. But lack of well-grounded and recent figures on population and poverty levels have worried leaders. “We have no decision at all on the third-generation formula. We are still in the consultative process. We don’t have the population numbers apart from figures the National Bureau of Statistics has,” CRA chairperson Jane Kiringai told the Star. She said developing the formula is a “technical process” and “we are back to the drawing board.” Click here for the latest political news
