The National Treasury is in the process of finalising the National Monitoring and Evaluation Policy, Treasury CS Henry Rotich has said. The policy will provide an enabling framework for the monitoring and evaluation function in the public sector to facilitate achievement of the country’s development agenda. “The policy is designed to guide implementation of the National Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation System, monitoring and evaluation capacity development and resource mobilization for monitoring and evaluation,” he said in a speech read by Julius Muia on Wednesday. The policy will harmonise monitoring and evaluation systems for all public projects, programmes and policies at all levels. “It will ensure timely and accurate reporting of progress and results at all levels and Strengthen capacity to effectively monitor and evaluate programmes/projects at all levels.” It will also strengthen coordination of M&E systems in the country and Promote a culture and practice of M&E in the country and Promote dissemination, communication and use of M&E findings for improved policies, programmes and projects performance.” Adherence to the policy will improve performance in execution of public programmes and projects at both levels of government and strengthen efficiency in utilization of resources. It will enhance effectiveness and efficiency as fundamental to managing public programmes and projects in Kenya, he said.
