Ali Kiba and Diamond Platnumz are coming together after years of feuding. The two are set to meet during the Wasafi Festival in Kenya on New Year’s Eve. Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Diamond invited Kiba to join him in the festival, pointing out that his aim was not to beef with him. "Inawezekana tukiwa pamoja na nia dhabiti ya kuikuza sanaa, lakini sio nia ya kiugomvi kati yetu," he said. Sadly, Kiba said he won’t be available. However, he said he is going to sponsor Diamond’s concert with his newly launched energy drink. "#Wasafi tumepata salamu zenu, nashukuru kwa mualiko wenu, ila kwa bahati mbaya sitoweza kushiriki kwa sasa kutokana na majukumu ya kuzindua Mofaya katika nchi zingine. Hata hivyo tusingependa kuwaacha hivi hivi, tupo tayari kuwapa support ya kudhamini tamasha lenu kupitia #MofayaEnergyDrink."
