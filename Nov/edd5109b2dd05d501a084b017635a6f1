Motorists in Nairobi will from next week pay reduced parking charges after governor Mike Sonko announced they will cut the fees from Sh300 to Sh200. Sonko yesterday said the reduced charges will apply to saloon cars parked in the city centre and other public parking spaces within the county. He said the changes have been included in the County Finance Bill, 2018 and that an agreement has been reached with MCAs for approval. “I have been consulting with various stakeholders including MCAs and we have agreed not to punish motorists,” Sonko said. City Hall had initially proposed to increase the charges to Sh400. Sonko said they will review the fees after ongoing projects to decongest the city are completed. “I know reducing the fees will increase congestion but we cannot punish Nairobians because projects like BRT and bus termini construction are still ongoing,” he said.
