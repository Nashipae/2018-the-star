Homa Bay residents are set to benefit from the Sh1 billion rural electrification project by the government. Deputy President William Ruto said the government intends to increase the number of households connected to electricity in Homa Bay to 40,000 by next year. Statistics show 10,000 homes were connected by 2013. Ruto spoke at Pala trading centre in Karachuonyo constituency on Monday. "Electricity is key to economic growth and this will improve the livelihood of the residents," he said. Both permanent and semi-permanent houses will be connected. "We are not going to discriminate against people with low-quality houses. People will have electric power whether they have iron sheet-walled houses or permanent houses," Ruto said. Kenya Electricity Transmission Company chairman James Rege said the electricity will improve the lives of residents who depend on paraffin for lighting and cooking. He said the project will also promote entrepreneurship. Ruto also launched the construction of Kanyadhiang’- Pala- Kadel road which is expected to boost trade. Click here for the latest political news
