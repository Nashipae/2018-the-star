KCB Group and 28 other global banks representing $17 trillion in combined assets yesterday launched the Principles for Responsible Banking in Paris, France. The guidlines will define the banking industry’s role and responsibilities in shaping a sustainable future. The six principles selected speak to banking business and culture are aligned to climate change, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and relevant national and regional frameworks’ themes. “We believe responsible business is about establishing and nurturing the foundation of growth for the next generations,’’ KCB Group chief executive Joshua Oigara said. The guidelines are expected to provide the first global framework that oversees the integration of sustainability across all business areas of a bank, from strategic, portfolio to transaction level. This initiative will see banks commit to being publicly accountable for their significant positive and negative social, environmental and economic impacts. ‘’I’m optimistic we’ll see a realignment of business practice – one that embraces the fact that green and socially responsible business is the best business,’’ UN assistant secretary general Satya Tripathi said.
