A garbage crisis has hit Naivasha town after a court stopped traders involved collection from operating following a dispute between them and another splinter group. Following the order from a Nakuru court, the over 20 groups that for years have been collecting garbage suspended their services, leaving the town choked in garbage. Instead, six companies that were tendered by the county to collect the garbage since 2016 have been given the responsibility by the court to conduct the business. Following the order, the groups pulled off their garbage collection trucks and staff from the estates, but vowed that they would not allow the new entrants into their ‘territory’. According to the order issued by the deputy registrar at the High Court in Nakuru, the groups should desist from operating in the town. Addressing the press after receiving the order, the groups said they had invested heavily in the trade and pointed out to some county officials for the current crisis. According to their spokesperson Martin Mugwe, they would respect the court order as they were law abiding citizens. He was however quick to question if the six groups had the capacity to collect garbage from all the estates. Click here for
