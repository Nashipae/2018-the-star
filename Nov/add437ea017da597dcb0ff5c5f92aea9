Unregulated trade in unauthorised places has contributed to the drop in revenue collection, a county official has said. Nairobi county assembly trade committee chairman Charles Thuo yesterday said most traders who have set up illegal structure do not pay licence fees. He told the Star more than 2,000 structures have been demolished in the last year as a measure to restore order. Thuo said people should go through the right process in acquiring their licences. In the current financial year, the trade sector aims to collect Sh3,492,398,000 in revenue. “If traders get licences in the right manner and the county plays it roles with launching projects. I’m certain we will attain and surpass the revenue target,” Thuo said. Trade is made up of five departments — markets, weights and measures, liqour licenses, betting, control and lotteries, and single business permits. The County Development Plan for 2018-19 shows revenue collected per department stood at Sh1.7 billion for single business permits, Sh244 million for markets and Sh7.8 million for weights and measures. Under betting, control and lotteries, only the pool tables and amusements machines generated Sh399,000. Under liquor, no revenue was collected. During an earlier meeting with the trade committee, Trade chief officer Fredrick Nzioki said a court case had hindered collection of the liquor revenue but the case was concluded towards the end of the last financial year. “This financial year we have been authorised to collect revenue from the liquor department,” Nzioki said.
