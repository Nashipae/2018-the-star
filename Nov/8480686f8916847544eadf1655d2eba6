Fast rising tennis sensation, Ryan Randiek, has expressed hopes of improving in the second leg of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) East Africa Junior circuit which gets underway at Nairobi Club today. Randiek bowed in the quarter finals of the first leg to Damien Laporte of Seychelles and he believes he will come back stronger and reach the final stages of the tournament. The promising rookie, who has been out for six months nursing an injury on his right hand knuckles, will be keen to muscle for the elusive boys title which has been won by foreigners this year. “I am looking forward to better last week’s results in both singles and doubles. Honestly, I am yet to hit my best after the long period of inaction but I believe I will perform better,” said Randiek. His compatriots Derrick Ominde,Jayson Mbogoro and Albert Njogu will be gunning for their maiden junior titles. Njogu lost in last week’s finals to Rostilav Galfinger of Kazakhstan while Ominde lost to the same opponent in the quarter finals. Ominde, who blamed his last week’s loss to ‘unsportsmanlike conduct’ by his opponent, vowed to be ruthless in the second leg. “I lost unfairly in the first leg but I hope things will be different in the second leg. I have learnt my mistakes and made amends and I will be aiming at nothing short of a title,” said Ominde. While the Kenyan boys will be seeking their first title, Sneha Kotecha will be out to defend her title which she won over the weekend. Sneha beat Laura Van Merwe of South Africa 7-5, 5-7, 7-5 to win her third junior crown this year. Meanwhile, Marin Cilic clinched Croatia’s second Davis Cup title as he beat France’s Lucas Pouille 7-6(3) 6-3 6-3 to give his side a decisive 3-1 lead in the final at Lille’s Stade Pierre Mauroy yesterday. The powerful world number seven was relentless as he snuffed out any hope of a famous French fightback — giving Pouille little chance of sending the final into a fifth rubber.
