Musalia Mudavadiâ€™s only chance is if he had the same chance
he had in 2013. That is, if someone gives him the space. He is not the kind of person to
fight for his own space. He has always been someone who has been given positions. He inherited
the seat from his father Moses Mudavadi, Moi handed him the vice presidency briefly in 2002, he was handed the Deputy Prime Minister position in 2008. So, he has
always been someone who expects to be given things. He is not a fighter for his
own space. His political clout is waning because if you look at even his own
home constituencies and counties, Raila got more votes than for the presidency in 2013. Mudavadi is not a force to reckon with. However, he becomes a force whenever he
is handed something. This is because a lot of people consider him a safe pair of hands, safe with the country and whenever he is handed an office
people feel safe. In 2013 Uhuru said he would hand over the ticket to Mudavadi
because he is considered almost docile. That's how I see Mudavadi. Where he comes from, the Luyha community, it's not easy to marshal unity. The Luyhas
have never come together and their unity remains a pipe dream. Looking at the previous election, there are only two
communities that can vote as a bloc. Every other community is too democratised.
There is no way you expect the Luhya community to vote as a bloc. That is not going
to happen. However, on the chance they do vote as a bloc, based on 2009 statistics
which show an increase in voter population in Luyhaland,
and if that increase is maintained, then the expectation would be that Mudavadi will be a force to reckon with. Anyone who will get upward of 80 per cent of the Luyha vote will
be someone to be taken quite seriously. Whether he will get the Gema votes is another story. The political analyst spoke to the Star Click here for the latest political news
