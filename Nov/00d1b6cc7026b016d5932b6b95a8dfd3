The Independent Policing Oversight Authority has launched a probe into the shooting of a tout in Kisauni, Mombasa county. Ali Athman, 28, was admitted to hospital with a bullet lodged in his neck after he was reportedly shot by police on Thursday night. He also sustained injuries on the chest during the incident and was rushed to Sayyida Fatimah Hospital in Kisauni. The bullet was removed under the watch of police, his parents, Ipoa and Muslims for Human Rights officers yesterday morning. Ipoa has since written an official letter to the hospital’s administration requesting to be given the bullet for further investigations. The authority has also recorded statements from witnesses over the incident. Athman’s family said police visited them twice on Thursday at the hospital and claimed that he had been shot by a stray bullet. His wife, Marian Musa, said her husband was shot when police were pursuing suspected criminals from Junda area in Kisauni. The incident occurred about a week after Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet ordered a crackdown on juvenile gangs. Boinnet said Kisauni had serious security challenges and police officers would deal with it “according to the law”. However, Muslims for Human Rights (Muhuri) said the shooting was in reaction to Boinnet’s statement. “The utterance from IG will worsen things. We ask the police to restrain from using live ammunition and excessive force. If they don’t comply, we will take legal action,” Chairman Khelef Khalifa said. He said the public was fearful of giving information to the police because of mistrust and told residents to inform them and they would pass it to the authorities. Muhuri has written to the Commission on Administrative Justice to take action against county police commander Johnston Ipara.
