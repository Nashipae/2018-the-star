Police in Kisumu are probing a claim by activist Audi Ogada that his life is danger. Ogada said he was threatened by county secretary Olang’o Onudi for demanding Onudi’s sacking over the Sh2.5 million erroneous advert on land rates defaulters. Governor Anyang Nyong’o apologised, saying the advert wrongly identified two members of former Vice President Jaramogi Oginda Odinga’s family as defaulters. Kisumu police boss Ancent Kaloki told the Star on the phone, “A probe is underway.” Three days earlier Ogada led Kisumu residents in demanding an explanation on the advert that cost tax payers millions of shillings. Kisumu Residents Voice Association chairman said Onudi called him using mobile phone number 0722 791874 and threatened him. He reported the call at Kisumu Central Police Station in OB 21/28/11/2018. “I want to authoritatively inform the general public that today, November 28, 2018, at about 7am the county secretary threatened my life,” Ogada said. “Onudi told me starting today he will deal with me ruthlessly if I don’t apologise following the statement I gave to the press on Tuesday over Sh2.5 million spent on advertising an erroneous, disparaging and scandalous land report by the task force,” he said. “He loudly shouted at me asking why I didn’t seek permission from him and that I am an outsider who cannot raise any issue within Kisumu,” he said, “Onudi further said that I and my family should be very careful from now on, or pack and leave Kisumu.” Ogada said the words amounted to a serious threat. Onudi denied threatening Ogada. “I have not,” he said in a text message on Wednesday. Residents demanded Governor Nyong’o should sack the county secretary for the false advert on rate defaulters thatmentioned the family of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga.
