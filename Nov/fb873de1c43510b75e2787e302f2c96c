A handcart pusher, who was charged with unlawful entry into Kenya Air Force's base in Eastleigh, was on Thursday released by a Milimani court. George Omulama, 20, was released after he pleaded guilty to gaining entry into the military barrack without permission. He was arrested by KDF officers manning the facility and handed over to the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit for investigation. This was after Omulama failed to explain what he wanted at the establishment. He told investigators that he is a water vendor and offers handcart transport around Taj Mall area in Pipeline estate. Appearing unaware of his predicament, Omulama told senior resident magistrate Hellen Okwani that he was on scavenging mission. He told the court that he did not know that the military establishment was a protected area. Okwani warned him not to repeat the offence. Click here for the latest political news
