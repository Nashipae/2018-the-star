The Constitution should be amended to increase the counties’ share of the national revenue from 15 per cent, Kitui governor Charity Ngilu has said. She said allocations should be made according to a county’s population and size. “It is not fair to have a county with more than 1.5 million people getting almost the same as a county with 700,000. Something needs to be done,” Ngilu said yesterday during a Building Bridges public participation forum at the Kitui Multipurpose Hall. Kitui is the task force’s first stop. Ngilu urged the advisory task force to incorporate citizens’ views and not doctor its final report. She said the country’s population is unknown, with some records putting the figure at 40 million, while others put it at 45 million. “We must have a system that shows the exact number of Kenyans for ease of planning and to attain development,” Ngilu said. She praised the Building Bridges Initiative, sayin it will promote reconciliation. Ngilu urged election losers to accept the outcome and support leaders. Member Amos Wako said the task force will not fail Kenyans. “We will deliver our mandate. Our initiative is part of the Handshake legacy and we are sure something good will come out of it,” he said.
