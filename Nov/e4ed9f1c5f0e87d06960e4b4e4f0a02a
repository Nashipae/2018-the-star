Otile Brown has finally responded to Vera Sidika after she bought her catch a brand new Mercedes Benz. This comes after Vera confessed that Otile had been asking for money to buy the same car. The two have been at each other's throats not once but twice, and they are quite fast to air their dirty laundry to the public. Taking to social media, Otile seemed to hint that Vera is riding on his wave, but all in all it's love. He wrote, “Don’t tryna ride on my wave you haven’t seen my boat.#BadMan #igotnothingbutlove” From the look of things, these two will be making headlines for a pretty long time.
