Gospel singer Size 8 has neither confirmed nor denied that she is expecting her second child. Fans have been sending her congratulatory message on photos she has been posting with a baby bump showing. "I will not deny nor confirm but let us wait and see, time will tell," she told Word Is yesterday. Wilson Grace wrote on one photo: "The inner transformation is showing on the outside. Seems your mind has been renewed, congratulations may God continue to reveal himself more unto you." Dorice wrote: "Congratulations Mama wambo. When are you breaking the news?" Size 8 expressed that after having complications in her first pregnancy, she has been having fears of conceiving again, but the fear is no longer there. "God will reveal that more as time goes by. I had fears of getting pregnancy again but I thank God after I joined Bible school, I was taught a lot of things that helped me fight the fear. That is why for a long time people were even wondering kwani Size 8 hazai tena?" she said. Not only did she experience complications but her mother passed away the day her baby girl was born. Although she did not wish to have a C-Section, she was forced to go for one due to her health status then. "My first pregnancy got me to the position of getting trauma, mpaka sikua nataka kurudi hapo," she said. Her daughter Ladasha turned three years old early this month. "Ladasha is a real miracle to me because were it not for the love of God, I would have lost her when she was still in my womb. She was too tiny as my placenta had complications and so she was not feeding well." She added that she is ready with names for her second born, of whatever gender. "I have finally overcomed my fear because I need to trust in God, and I am ready for any blessing, either baby boy or girl. Vile tu God atajiskia, let his will be done." Size 8 encourages all people to trust God for great things because he is the way and the truth in whatever hardships they are going through in life.
