Lazy and incompetent staff in Makueni county must prepare to go home, Governor Kivutha Kibwana has warned. He said on Monday that executives and chief officers who cannot deliver on their mandate will not be spared. The second-term governor said his administration will not tolerate lethargy. He spoke during a baraza at Mwaani market, Kaiti. He commissioned growth projects. “We were elected to serve and we must deliver. You applied for the job and we considered you, there is no excuse for failure,” Kibwana said. He said he will not listen to any executive or chief officer blaming contractors for failed projects. “If a contractor fails, it means the employer who is either the executive or the chief officer has also failed. I’ll also be said to have failed. So, I’ll stop the chain before it reaches me by sacking you,” Kibwana said. He said devolution can only be beneficial through projects that transform lives. Kaiti MP Joshua Kimilu, three executives and chiefs officers were present. Heath chief officer Patrick Musyoki said they aim to improve services after they were rated the best-performing department.
