A petition filed in Parliament seeking to reduce requirements prescribed in the LSK Act of 2014 for one to run for top offices of the organisation has sparked mixed reactions. Law Society of Kenya CEO Mercy Wambua (pictured) petitioned the National Assembly seeking a review of section 18 of the Act. It provides that for one to run for LSK president or deputy president, one must have practiced as an advocate for 15 years. On March 24, LSK resolved to petition Parliament to incorporate changes into the Act. The Justice and Legal Affairs Committee, chaired by Baringo North MP William Cheptumo, has 60 days to dispense with the petition and table a report.

Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo supported the petition, saying there is a need to change the provisions. West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi said 15 years is too long and the LSK should revert to the initial 10 years requirement. Majority leader Aden Duale and Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa said there is a need to reduce the requirements. Minority leader and Suba South MP John Mbadi said there should be a balance between experience and age. Those opposing the changes, led by Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma, Gladys Shollei of Uasin Gishu and Jeniffer Shamalla, say experience factor is critical for one to contest for such a position.
