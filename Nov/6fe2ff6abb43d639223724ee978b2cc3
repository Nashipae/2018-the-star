Homeboyz’s Johnstone Olindi and Mwamba’s Sammy Taabu have been called up to the Kenya Sevens squad for the season’s opening legs in Dubai and Cape Town next week. The, duo who excelled at the national Sevens circuit as well as the Africa Cup and Safari Sevens, made the cut in the 12-man squad named yesterday by head coach Paul Murunga. Blak Blad’s Brian Wahinya also got the nod while Leonard Mugaisi and Alvin Otieno both of Homeboyz, returned to the squad. Eden Agero will skipper the youthful squad which also feature the experienced Dennis Ombachi. Herman Humwa, Eric Ombasa and Jeff Oluoch are the only returnees from last season. Announcing the squad, Murunga said they are ready for the opener in the Arabian Gulf. “We have had an intense four weeks of training and we want to take each game at a time in Dubai. It’s a good blend of experience and youth and we are ready for the challenge ahead of the season,” noted Murunga. Kenya face Olympic champions Fiji, a resurgent Scotland and France in Pool B. Murunga admitted that their opponents Scotland and France are tricky and would need proper planning. He, however, noted: “ We are ready for them and we must beat them. Fiji play an unstructured style of rugby and we can’t allow them to dictate play.” The team leaves on Sunday and are expected back in the country on December 11. Murunga will be without five players currently in France with the Simbas for the repechage. They include top try scorer Collins Injera, former skipper Andrew Amonde, Willy Ambaka, Nelson Oyoo and Sammy Oliech. Squad: Charles Omondi Dennis Ombachi, Eden Agero, Johnstone Olindi, Sammy Taabu, Leonard Mugaisi, Eden Agero, Eric Ombasa, Herman Humwa, Jeff Oluoch, Brian Wahinya and Alvin Otieno.
