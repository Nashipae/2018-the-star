Leaders from Mandera are demanding independent investigations into the shooting of a woman in Rhamu town by police. Milk vendor Abdia Omar, 55, was shot dead by police on patrol on Monday. They were pursuing a man accused of selling drugs, when they shot the woman. Residents demonstrated and accused police of extrajudicial killings. But police say the woman was mistakenly shot as she tried to shield her son, whom police were pursuing for allegedly selling drugs. It all started when police approached a group of youths and tried to arrest the suspect, only identified as Mohamed. But the youth ran away and police gave a chase and accosted him in their house. Speaking in Mandera town yesterday, Rhamu MCA Kula Alio and Mohamed Ibrahim of Guticha disputed the police version of events and accused them of extra-judicial killing. The ward representatives said there is no way police, who were involved in the shooting, can investigate themselves, hence, the need for an independent agency to probe. Alio said the postmortem had revealed the woman was shot at close range, an indication police deliberately decided to kill her. “It is clear the police decided to kill the innocent and defenseless woman for reasons known better to them. We are calling on the independent Policing Oversight Authority to come in. We are not comfortable with the local DCI officers carrying out the investigations,” he said. Alio said three days after the shooting, police have only been assuring them that investigations will be conducted, but they fear the killing will be swept under the carpet. Ibrahim said police should have arrested Abdia instead of shooting her. “We will soon organise the mother of all demonstrations in Rhamu town if police continue dragging their feet in this matter. We want to see progress in the investigations,” Ibrahim said. Mandera North deputy county commissioner Kiplagat Tarus said investigators are pursuing the matter and urged the leaders and residents to be patient.
