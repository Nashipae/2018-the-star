Turkana county secretary Peter Eripete on Sunday warned youths against using social media to attack the county government over insecurity. Turkana county has been attacked several times by suspected bandits leading  to deaths. “Its the role of the national government to ensure its citizens are protected. The so-called bloggers getting seated with keyboards posting on social media that the county government has failed to curb insecurity are wrong and should stop ,” Eripete said.
