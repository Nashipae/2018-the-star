A section of Meru MCAs want Isiolo International Airport given a name that resonates with residents. They say the airport is in Meru. Yesterday, they threatened to impeach Public Service and Labour executive Kiautha Arithi for failing to definitively respond to their questions about the facility. “Isiolo Airport land belongs to Meru. We should demand it be called Meru. I expect people working there to be from Meru, Embu, Tharaka Nithi and Machakos. But when we seek clarification, we get nonsense. It’s not the first time. We approve appointees, we should deal with them,” Kimathi Ithibua (Kiegoi Antubochiu) said. The Labour committee had demanded a report on the number of residents employed, especially those from Athwana, infrastructure development plans to benefit their people, the number of residents with business permits and an affirmative action plan for residents’ businesses. Arithi provided a one-sentence response, which was tabled by PNU-nominated MCA Petronilla Ikiao. He said the airport is a national property and does not belong to the county. This sparked debate. “I knew it was under the national government, but the county needs to claim the facility as 85 per cent of the airport sits in Athwana. He never engaged the CS, the airport managers and other players. “I reject his report and request the assembly to summon the CEC and force him do a thorough job,” Majority leader Victor Karithi said. He is the Athwana ward representative. Kiguchwa’s Linus Atheinya urged Arithi to resign.
