Kenya is ready to support peace initiatives across its borders with Uganda and South Sudan, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa has said. Eugene on Tuesday said the government is conducting peace initiatives across the border involving the Karamoja from Uganda and Toposa of South Sudan. “President Uhuru Kenyatta has rolled out the peace programme with Turkana governor Josphat Nanok. We expect to sign a Memorandum of Understanding between Kenya and Uganda soon,” Eugene said. He spoke when he launched the Kenya Development Response to Displacement Impact Project in Lodwar, Turkana. Eugene said the Sh10 billion World Bank grant to counties hosting refugees will not be effective if there was no peace across the border. Last month, the CS warned pastoralists against cattle rustling, saying it might scare away humanitarian agencies. “Projects conducted by NGOs cannot prosper without peaceful coexistence among communities living on the border of Kenyan, South Sudan, Uganda and Ethiopia,” Eugene said during the launch of a livestock market in Lodwar. He said frequent conflicts in the region have derailed development. The CS said there was need to establish the causes of conflicts that have caused people to flee into Kenya. “We must go beyond the borders to see how we can address cross border issues and reduce conflict caused by cattle rustling, pressure on limited access to water and pastures,” he said. He said the government was keen on bring together the Turkana of Kenya, Karamoja (Uganda), Toposa (South Sudan) and Nyangatom (Ethiopia) through the “Ateker Cluster” for development projects including building of shared dams.
