Solai dam owner Perry Manusukh has gone to court seeking to travel out of the country for the fourth time. The dam collapsed in May killing 48 people. Manusukh, who has been charged with manslaughter, wants to travel to India and Sudan at the end of the week on business trips. Lawyer Boniface Masinde said the businessman intends of travel to Sudan between tomorrow and December 5. He also wants to travel to India between December 6 and 11 to visit his son. Masinde told Naivasha principal magistrate Esther Kimilu the accused had in the past travelled out of the country three times and complied with the bond terms. But the DPP, through an affidavit sworn by State Counsel Victor Owiti, said the accused is a flight risk. The prosecution said Manusukh has not provided details of his visits. “He has not filed documents or travel itinerary to show where in particular he is travelling to in Sudan or India,” he said. The magistrate will make a ruling today. Click here for the latest political news
