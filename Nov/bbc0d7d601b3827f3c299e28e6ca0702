Garissa police killed a suspected al Shabaab militant on Sunday night and injured several others who attempted to attack the Rural Border Patrol Unit. Regional commissioner Mohamed Birik said the militants struck the camp in Ijara towards midnight but officers drove them back. "Our gallant officers reacted immediately the militants struck and engaged them in a fierce gun battle. They finally managed to repulse them. No officer was injured,” he said. Birik did not reveal the number of attackers or the identity of the slain one. He however said several of them escaped with serious injuries. “As we speak a contingent of officers, which includes the regular officers, rural border patrol unit, GSU and the military, are on their trail. It is just a matter of time before we apprehend them,” Birik said. He said efforts to “vanquish and eliminate al Shabaab remain on course” and more activities and will be carried out in the next few weeks. Police said the militants wanted to carry out simultaneous attacks on the police camp and a nearby Safaricom mast. The attack came barely two weeks after Birik toured Holugho and met security officials and residents. Ijara subcounty is vulnerable to al Shabaab attacks due to its proximity to Boni Forest and Somalia, where the militants hide. Birik commended the officers, saying they don’t get enough praise for selflessly defending Kenya’s borders. He urged wananchi to report anyone with bullet wounds to law enforcement officers.
