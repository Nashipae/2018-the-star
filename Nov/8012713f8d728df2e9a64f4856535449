KRA has threatened to freeze the accounts for Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja's office over Sh13.9 million outstanding arrears that were not paid during Governor Mike Sonko's tenure. Sonko served as the Nairobi Senator between 2013 to 2017. The National Hospital Insurance Fund and National Social Security Fund are also demanding Sh 97,000 and 47,202 respectively. In a letter seen by the Star to the Senate Clerk, Sakaja said the arrears including interests and penalties amount to Sh14,096,753. "I therefore request your office to take up the matter and expedite it to avoid halting of operations in our office since KRA has already initiated a debt recovery process and have indicated that they will be freezing all the funds in our bank account meant for salaries and office operations," Sakaja said in the letter to theÂ Clerk. He said during his period his office has complied fully with the law on matters statutory deductions. In a letter written on November 14, KRA said the Senator's office has not remitted PAYE for payroll month of July 2013 to August 2017 contrary to the provisions of section 37 of the Income Tax Act. 'Note, due to the unavailability of PAYE returns and payroll records, the amount due have been estimated and subjected to late payment penalties and interests. You are therefore required to remit the outstanding amount of Sh13,952,551 to the commissioners of domestic taxes immediately to avoid further accrual of penalties and interests" it said.
