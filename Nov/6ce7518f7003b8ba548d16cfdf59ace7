Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has declined to honour a bet he entered with a friend on Gor Mahia Vs Everton game that was played on Tuesday night. Everton thrashed Gor 4-0 to clinch the SportPesa cup at the Goodison Park stadium in the UK. In a video that has gone viral, Murkomen is filmed with three other people and comedian Propesa making a bet. The latter placed his bet on Everton. Propesa had said that if Gor Mahia won, he would supply game kits and balls to five schools of Murkomen's choice. "I want us to have a bet with you Mheshimiwa, if Everton wins I want you to choose ten schools where you will take balls to develop young talents," Propesa said.
