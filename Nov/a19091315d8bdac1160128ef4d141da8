Makueni county governor Kivutha Kibwana has said he doesn't mind running for presidency in 2022. A fierce online campaign was launched by netizens asking the governor not to retire from politics. The campaign followed Kibwana's development record as was highlighted at the devolution conference in April. He told accountants at an Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK) meeting in Mombasa that he wouldn't mind going for the top seat 'as long as he has support'. "I would not mind. If 75 per cent of you (accountants) think it is a good idea and I get support of over 17,000 of you, I would take it serious," Kibwana said at the Wednesday meeting.

Kalonzo's declaration that he was ready to work with Uhuru was opposed by leaders from lower Eastern. The three governors have also created a new profound relationship that has raised eyebrows on what is cooking in the Kamba region.
