Meru artistes have rallied behind Ameru Crew's Wycliffe Muthomi as he seeks to be the director of Music Copyright Society of Kenya Eastern Region. Ameru Crew is a gospel group known for many hit songs sang in Kimeru, including 'Mwinere' (Singing for the almighty). Wcyliffe Muthomi has been seeking support from artistes to win the seat, which has been dominated by Ukambani for many years. He faces three other aspirants from the region. "It is a bit challenging to campaign across the entire Eastern region. Furthermore, I am the first artiste from Meru and entire Upper Eastern to vie for the seat, but I'm confident I will emerge triumphant," Muthomi said. He said if elected he will improve the welfare of musicians in the region by ensuring proper remuneration for their music.
