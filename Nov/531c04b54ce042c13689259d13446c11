A fisherman is admitted at the Naivasha sub-county hospital after he was shot on the leg for illegal fishing in Lake Naivasha. Following the Tuesday night incident, a group of his colleagues on Wednesday held protests and burnt down a police boat used in the operation. Trouble started when a group of fishermen were found near Karagita beach at around 11 pm which is past the regulated hours. “Once challenged to surrender, the eight suspects attacked the officers using stones and the officers opened fire hitting one of them on the leg,” said one of the officers in the operation.
