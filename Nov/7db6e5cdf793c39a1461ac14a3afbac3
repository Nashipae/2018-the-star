Migori governor Okoth Obado will spend a night at the Gigiri police cells pending the ruling on his bail application in the gun case. Chief magistrate Joyce Gandani on Thursday said the bail ruling will be delivered on Friday. The county boss was arraigned in Kibera. Police had sought 15 days to detain Obado for further investigations into the illegal gun possession case. The governor was arrested by DCI on Wednesday after an EACC raid at his Nairobi and Migori homes netted eight guns. The defence team led by Cliff Ombeta argued that the governor has cooperated with security agencies hence should be granted bail. He further argued that the county boss, who is also facing a murder charge, has lived by the bail terms for the said case. The defence further told the court that Obado is not a flight risk and will present himself when needed by the investigative agencies. Ombeta also dismissed the DPP's request for more days on grounds of conducting a ballistic examination at the scene. "The guns were transported to Nairobi. We saw them at the DCI headquarters. We wonder what the officers will be looking at yet there was no shooting at either of the homes," Ombeta told the court.
