Garissa governor Ali Korane has said he will sack workers who fail to show up for work. He
said he would fire some county administrators who neglect their duties at the
expense of serving the people. The
governor said he was aware of some administrators who were always politicking
in hotels instead of working from their stations. “I
have realized that some of you still have political hangovers and you are yet
to understand your role as a public servant. I will not hesitate to replace you
if you fail to match our expectations,'' Korane said. Korane,
who also served as an administrator during retired President Daniel Moi’s
regime, warned the workers from engaging in politics that will undermine their
relationship with MPs and MCAs. Speaking
at a Garissa hotel on Saturday during a sub-county administrators training
workshop, Korane called for an attitude change from workers to ensure work
efficiency. He
urged them to perfect their relationship with other public servants to
implement shared roles and responsibilities. Korane
said administrators are at all times expected to oversee the implementation of
government projects at the grassroots, provide leadership to staff serving
under them and play the role of peace-building. He
assured the staff of his administration’s support in training to strengthen
their skills and capacity building. Korane
said a bill on peace building and integration that will have structures, role
of elders and other stakeholders will soon be tabled at the county
assembly. The
governor also took issue with the administrators’ uniform, which he termed as ‘colonial’
and should be done away with. “I
opposed the uniform that was borrowed from the colonial government and
perceived as a tool for forceful implementation of government
initiatives," he said.
