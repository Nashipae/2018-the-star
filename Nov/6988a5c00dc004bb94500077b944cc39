Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia have been drawn against Nyasa Bullets of Malawi in the forthcoming Africa Champions League to be held on November 27/28. Gor return to the Champions League after falling in the second round last year to Tunisian giants Esperance, dropping to the Confederations Cup where they defied odds to punch their way into the group stages. The 17-time Kenyan champions will host the Malawians in the first leg before jetting out for the return leg in Blantyre a week later. Dylan Kerr charges, who boast of arguably the best pre-season ever, have already submitted the name of players who will play in the tournament. However, it will be race against time for the club to negotiate a new deal for right back Karim Nizigiyimana and register him before the first leg match. Karim who has won three league titles with Gor was omitted from the initial squad submitted to Cairo as the club is yet to renew his contract, which expires at the end of the year and if the performance against Everton is to go by, the club will fight to retain him by all means and have his name registered for the tournament. The winner of the two-legged preliminary encounter will face the winner between UMS De Loum of Cameroon and Lodi Stars of Nigeria. SportPesa Shield champions Kariobangi Sharks have been pitted against Arta Solar 7 of Djibouti in the Confederations Cup which starts on November 27/28. Sharks will be making their debut at the continental stage against the unheralded Horn of Africa side. If they overcome the Djiboutians, Sharks — who submitted a largely young squad to CAF — will face either Ghanaian giants Asante Kotoko or a undetermined Cameroonian side in the next round.
