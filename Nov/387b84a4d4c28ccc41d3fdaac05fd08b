The government has banned children from accessing beaches past 6pm. Kwale County commissioner Karuku Ngumo on Wednesday said that children found roaming around the beach past the set time will be punished and their parents prosecuted for neglecting their duties. He warned parents against leaving their children to roam the beaches at night especially during the festive holidays to avoid criminal incidents involving minors. "Action will be taken on any child who will be found at the beach during this festive season especially now that we have several artistes from East Africa coming to the country for the holidays," Ngumo said.

"We don't want our children to be allowed to walk at night to weddings or to the beach. We want children to remain to be children and we will deal with the parents if we see a child around such places," he said.
