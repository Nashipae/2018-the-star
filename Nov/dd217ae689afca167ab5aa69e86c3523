Most people associate fire with death and destruction, but there are controlled conditions that cause fire to bring life. The Nairobi National Park is in a very tough situation. Human developments have virtually surrounded the park. The current reality is that the ancient migration routes have been reduced to a mere trickle. And over a period of time, especially after good rains this year, the plant biomass has grown and dried out. With the migration route being severely restricted, I believe it is important that alternative methods be considered to ensure more herbivores remain inside the park boundaries. If the herbivores remain inside then the predators, such as lions, will tend to remain inside the park. The challenge is to “turn the herds” as quickly as possible after the rains, when their natural instinct to migrate happens. Controlled burning programmes have been very successful in many places in Africa, especially if measured scientific methods are used. To burn dry grass biomass and successfully transform a “dead grass” area to have fresh green shoots attracting herbivores, a “cold fire” method is required. This is a controlled fire condition, where a fire is lit in a demarcated zone with firebreaks, at an ambient temperature of less than 20°C, with a humidity of over 50 per cent. It is important that the timing of the fire simulates a “lightning strike” just before a rainstorm. Scientifically it has been proven that burning should happen approximately every 10 years, depending on the climate of an area. The timing needs to be right when planning for selected areas of the park to be burned with “cold” fires. Hopefully KWS will do this action, and bring new life to the park in March next year.
