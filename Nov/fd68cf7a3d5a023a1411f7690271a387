The son of the late Benedict Karau, whose heart is claimed to have been stolen by a former chief government pathologist, yesterday said his father died of injuries inflicted on the head and upper arm. Lawyer Charles Mwongela, the son of the late Karau, told senior resident magistrate Evans Mbicha during a fresh hearing that after the death of his father, his step-mother and her family collaborated with the former Government Pathologist Moses Njue to cover up the exact cause of his death. “There were attempts to stop the second postmortem by first wife to my father Martha Gakou and her family. But my private pathologist, Maingi, government pathologist Johansson Odour, Scolastica Kimani and Moses Njue had agreed to conduct the postmortem,” he said. He recalled that he proposed a postmortem after shocking and mysterious death of his father on the night of March 2, 2015. The deceased had three wives, namely, Veronica Ciabi (deceased), Christine Kananu and Martha. A postmortem was then conducted in the presence of Scolastica Kimani, a government pathologist at Meru Level 5 Hospital, pathologist Johansson Odour in the presence of family representatives Peter Koome, Robert Kirimi and Joseph Mwirigi. The results from the two pathologists allegedly indicated that the deceased had in the first postmortem died of heart attack. Mwongela said he was not satisfied with the results and, because his father had been buried, he decided to seek more clarification since the results also indicated that his father’s blood tested alcohol yet he never took alcohol. He said he consulted Peter Kiama, a forensic pathologist. Kiama told him (Mwongela) the results indicated the body was embalmed and refrigerated, possibly to hide the evidence. Mwongela said Njue, the Embu Level 5 Hospital CEO, promised that he would bring it (heart) back within two weeks. But he did never honour the promise. Other pathologists had said those organs were very vital for the exercise, Mwongela said.
