The Movement for Democratic Advancement yesterday criticiced MPs’ new push for more allowances, terming it as selfish, arrogant and greedy and has no place in a democratic nation. In a press statement read by the chairman Okung Ndege during a briefing in Nairobi, the socialist mass movement expressed its disappointment with the manner in which the culture of greed, entitlement and self-indulgence still maintains its firm grip on the Kenyan Parliament. “Despite the public outrage over their spectacular expenses, MPs continue to show utter disdain for the Kenyan electorate with their extravagant pay claims and lavish perks,” Ndege said. Ndege said that MPs displayed “immoral and highly oxymoronic” behavior meant to exploit the common man despite their tribulations. He said the decision by the legislators is unacceptable and they are considering legal action to make sure the proposed bill does not see the light of the day. He said the country’s economy is already hurting from many Chinese loans and increasing MPs salary and allowances would destroy it further. “MDF will soon meet its vibrant legal team with a view of instituting public interest litigation against each of the elected and nominated MPs,” Ndege said. Secretary general Joseph Muli urged the civil society, the Judiciary and other professional bodies to be vigilant and resists all attempts by MPs to pass the Parliamentary Service Bill 2018. He urged President Kenyatta to distance himself from the Bill, arguing it is in bad faith. “The same way the President is ready to lose friends in the fight against corruption, we urge him to be ready to lose friends again over this Parliamentary Service Bill and save Kenyans,” he said.
