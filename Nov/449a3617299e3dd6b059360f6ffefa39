Busia deputy governor Moses Mulomi (pictured) yesterday called for urgent measures to prevent and manage any outbreak of Ebola from the DR Congo. Speaking yesterday at a training workshop on Ebola preparedness at Hotel Afrique, Mulomi said the best approach is prevention. He said that can only be achieved through awarenessof the virus, its symptoms and scrupulous avoidance of risky activity. “We must take Ebola seriously. The situation in the DR Congo is real, thus the need to be on the lookout and ensure our country doesn’t find itself in a similar situation,” he said. Mulomi said that despite measures already in place, lack of resources and access to information by border residents are hampering awareness campaigns. He called for more financial support and capacity building, education and training of the public. The workshop comes a few weeks after a visit to Busia by Health CS Sicily Kariuki to assess Ebola preparedness.
