The rift between Jubilee MPs in Bungoma county and Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa is escalating. The MPs have now asked Wamalwa to immediately tender his apology after referring to them as ‘mediocres’. Speaking at a church service at Chebosi SA in Bokoli Ward Webuye West constituency on Sunday, Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama and his Kimilili counterpart Didmus Barasa castigated Wamalwa for lacking respect despite them lobbying for him to be appointed a CS by the Jubilee government. “We went has far as threatening President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto that failure to appoint Wamalwa as a CS we will mobilise all MPs and support the opposition outfit NASA. Now that Wamalwa was appointed, he is turning against us,” said Barasa. Wanyama said that Bungoma MPs forfeited their position and gave it to Wamalwa, who is from Trans Nzoia county. “In 2013 it took us three years to negotiate a post for him to be appointed the CS, he should not be like a warthog, we should not sell out Luhya birthright through losing the network like Wamalwa is doing,” he said.
