Vera Sidika has been the subject of many trolls, but the one that reduced her to tears was when "haters" told her on social media that she is HIV positive. "Before I did the bleaching, some people trolled me online, saying I was HIV positive," Vera told Massawe on Radio Jambo. The socialite became famous after featuring in P-Unit’s You Guy video, and that was the same time she received hatred from some followers. "I was famous in my own circles and I used to have many followers on my Facebook page, and also as a cover girl of the Pulse magazine, and so I already had a name," she said. "It was my haters and people I was modelling with, because I had a huge following and I became famous before them." Adding: "People know that I am clean because I have done several tests online." How did she handle the hate? "I cried so much and I even called my mother about it. I mean, it was so tough for me," she said. Since then, she has developed a thick skin and no longer concentrates on trolls. "I nowadays love the trolls because most of the people who troll me are not because they hate me, but because they want to seek attention with my page. I can explain, some of them have few likes on their page, but when they put up something in my post, they get so many likes, and that is what I think excites them," she said. Vera Sidika was recently in a relationship with singer Otile Brown, but they broke up after Vera accused him of taking advantage of her financially. “I did not give him money that he wanted me to. He wanted 500K to buy a new Mercedes after trading in his current car," she said. Some of their fans thought the two might be pulling a publicity stunt, but Vera denied this. "Now that I am 29 years old I have thought of having a family, but I am concentrating on my business first. However, I don't stage anything and my love for Otile Brown was real," she said.
