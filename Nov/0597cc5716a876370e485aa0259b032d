The anti-graft agency has picked 14 candidates to battle it out for an opportunity to replace outgoing CEO Halakhe Waqo. The candidates include EACC deputy CEO Michael Mubea, former KDF operations spokesman Cyrus Oguna and current EACC director of investigations Abdi Mohamud. Former IPOA chief executive Joel Mabonga, assistant DPP James Warui and Reuben Chirchir, who was one of the joint secretaries to the tribunal that probed Supreme Court Justice Philip Tunoi, have been shortlisted. Former National Police Service Commission board official Murshid Mohamed is also shortlisted. Others are Sarah Kilemi, James Warui, Vincent Omari, Jillo Kasse, Chege Thenya, Twalib Mbarak, Joel Mabonga and Lucy Wanja. According to a public notice by EACC chairman Archbishop [Rtd] Eliud Wabukala, interviews for the shortlisted candidates will be between November 27-29 . Some 71 Kenyans had applied for the position following the expiry of Halakheâ€™s term. The EACC advertised the CEO position on October 9. Waqo took office in January 2013, when EACC replaced the now-defunct Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission. The post is a one term non-renewable contract of six years. The names of the successful candidate will be forwarded to the National Assembly for vetting and approval. Qualifications for the post include, a post-graduate degree, clearance certificates from KRA, DCI, Higher Education Loans Board, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Credit Reference Bureau.
