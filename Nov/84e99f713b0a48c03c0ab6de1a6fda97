Gospel singer Size 8 has had sleepless nights producing her new song, Holy Holy, due to the dramatic production team who worked for her. "That song is a testimony because it had so many challenges. The fact that it is out on social media is a big achievement to me," the singer told Word Is. The mother of one announced the release song on social media last week, saying: "Working on my new video 'Holy Holy' and I must say in all my life I've never seen the obstacles I've seen in this song waaaaaaa from the recording sessions to the video shot to the editing waaaaaaa. But I know victory belongs to Jesus no one can stand against the Lord and this song shall move the world for God's glory I am not loosing faith in my God." So, what was the main problem? "The production team was all drama. I have been spending sleepless nights because of this song," Size 8 said. "I recorded the song for so long but it had a lot of fight. I have never cried because of a song. Although I don't want to shame anyone I worked with but from recording to shooting...," she said. "As a Christian I am supposed to hide my brother and so I won't expose anyone, but the problem was the production of the audio. I even felt like God was not working and I almost lost hope." The secular-turned-gospel artiste has been congratulated by fans after the new song, in which she worked with both gospel and secular artistes. "God brings His own people to worship Him. You may think just because an artiste is a secular artiste, they have no good relationship with the Lord, but that is not correct. Working with the secular artiste in this song was so amazing," she said. "The song has blessed many souls, and its purpose was to remind people that God is not like a human being. His greatness can't be explained and they should therefore take their time to worship Him."
