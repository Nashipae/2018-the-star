It seems Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa's efforts to make peace with ODM have borne fruit if photos that have emerged are anything to go by. Jumwa is seen laughing her heart out and exchanging pleasantries with ODM leader Raila Odinga, Siaya senator James Orengo, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and other MPs who had gathered ahead of the vote on the Gender Bill on Thursday. Others present included Makueni senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr and Tongaren MP, Eseli Simiyu. Jumwa and her Msambweni counterpart Suleiman Dori were summoned in October to appear before the ODM disciplinary committee after they openly declared their support for Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. They ignored the summons. In June 2018, Jumwa was on record saying that she had made up her mind and would support DP Ruto as he is ready for the country’s top job irking the party leadership. However in October Jumwa had changed tune and declared that she respects Raila as her party leader. Jumwa said she was in constant communication with Raila. As the saying goes - all's well that ends well. Read: Jumwa’s ‘dirty’ words a big shame - Kassim Click here for the latest political news
