The boda boda rider who carries you from one place to another in Mombasa may actually be a police officer on patrol. You could also be buying roasted maize on the streets from an undercover cop. These are some of the new police tactics employed by police to tackle the new crime wave that has swept parts of Kisauni and Nyali constituencies in Mombasa. The security agencies have identified Junda, Mtopanga and Kadzandani wards as criminal hotspots in the coastal city.  Speaking on Wednesday at a security baraza in Junda ward, county commissioner Evans Achoki said security personnel will from now on be strategically positioned. “We will be everywhere and anywhere. We will not be in uniform. We will be watching you every step of the way,” Achoki said. He said the new methods adopted by police was necessitated by the ever-evolving tactics used by criminals. “Mombasa county police commander Johnston Ipara warned that criminals will not be spared in the latest crackdown. “Police will not debate with criminals. We catch you with a machete you are done,” Ipara said.
