The trial of the Sh225 million NYS corruption case has been adjourned. This is after defence lawyers complained that the magistrate overlooked the rights of the accused persons when he declined to adjourn the case on Wednesday. The lawyers also want the court to bar the Nation Newspaper from covering the case arguing that they have an interest and have been painting their clients in a bad light. Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti will, however, deliver his ruling tomorrow, Friday. The magistrate on Wednesday declined to adjourn the hearings.

The group is the first batch of suspects the DPP Noordin Haji said should be charged in relation to the loss of Sh225 million at the agency. The charges range from conspiracy to commit an offence of Economic Crime, abuse of Office, willful failure to comply with applicable procedures and guidelines relating to the management of public funds. Others are neglect of official duties, fraudulently making payments, breach of Trust, making documents without authority and uttering false documents. The suspects will also be charged with false accounting, fraudulent acquisition of public property, dealing with suspect property and money laundering. In total, 54 suspects will face trial in the loss of Sh468 million from the youth service in the trial spread across three clusters. All the suspects have denied charges of conspiring to defraud the agency.
