Safaricom is in plans to completely phase out use of diesel generators to power its 4,945 sites across the country, a report from the company shows. Released last week, Safaricoms 2018 Sustainability Business Report reveals that the move is aimed at achieving network availability and energy efficiency goals. In the last 12 months ending September 30, the mobile service provider experienced 6.9 hours of network outage largely due to power outages and transmission failures. The interruption in energy supply saw the telco market leader record 22.2 minutes of Service Unavailability Rate, a slight drop from 22.9 minutes recorded in Financial year 2017. “We are not satisfied with this results, however , and will redouble our effort to achieve a SUR of below 15 minutes in the coming financial year,” the report said. According to the survey, Safaricom is now in plans to employ alternative energy sources such as solar and avoiding diesel generators wherever possible. Data from the survey shows that the number of sites powered 24/7 by diesel generators reduced by 59.16 per cent this year to 78 sites down from 191 sites recorded as at September 2017. As a result, the amount of fuel used by the telco in the review period reduced by 18 per cent to 9.43 million litres from 11.48 million litres in 2017. The 113 sites were moved to the national grid for larger sites that provide critical coverage while the smaller sites were moved to the solar based energy solution that provide additional capacity. This saw electricity consumed increased by 21 per cent to 141,500 Megawatts per hour from 116,988 Mwh. In addition, the number of sites connected to the national grid increase by 149 to 3,755 and an additional 22 sites were converted to Solar or wind and hybrid power solutions. Currently, atleast 155 sites are powered by Solar. Besides this, Safaricom has announced roll out of a Fuel Management System that will provide data on site fuel consumption remotely. As at September 30,the system was installed in atleast 1,173 sites, 850 were are already commissioned and operational. The new measures have seen the telco reduce the cost of energy consumption by site reduce by Sh1,103 to Sh47,511 per mnth.This means that Safaricom saved a total Sh65.45 million in energy cost within the review period. "The main reason for this improvement is a decrease in generator running time which has resulted in less diesel being consumed," the report states. It further reveals that Safaricom has began replacing the generators at sites that have an average running time of two hours per day with deep cycle batteries or solar power solutions. Also being deployed include Low voltage Auto Phase Selectors, free cooling unit and replacing rectifiers and smarter controlling units. According to the United Nations Sustainable goal on affordable and clean energy buildings and industry should cut electricity consumption by 14 per cent in the next 12 years. This means avoiding roughly 1,300 mid-size power plants, and investing in clean energy sources such as solar, wind and thermal.
