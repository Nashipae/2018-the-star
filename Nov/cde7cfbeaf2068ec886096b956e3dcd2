Nairobi assembly’s Health committee will this week meet stakeholders as it seeks to crack down on clinics operating illegally. The committee will meet county health and trade officials, Knun and Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board representatives. Women’s Caucus chairperson Doris Kanario last week requested for a statement on the number of clinics operating without licences following the expose on quack doctor Mugo wa Wairimu. Health committee chairman Peter Warutere yesterday said Mugo might be one of many quacks in the city. “The quack was in Githurai and after we chased him, he landed in Kayole where he is still a danger to residents. We want to know who is feeding him because he cannot be operating alone,” he said. Warutere wondered who was supplying drugs to Mugo’s clinic. “He is operating a clinic without a licence; how is he getting drugs? Who is supplying those drugs?” he said. In 2015, Mugo was accused of sedating and raping his patients in his illegal clinics in Zimmerman and Githurai. He was charged with 12 counts including rape and operating clinics illegally.
