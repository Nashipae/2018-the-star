Machakos MCAs have passed a motion to impeach deputy governor Francis Maliti from the position of County Executive Committee (CEC) Finance. Maliti was on Wednesday ousted after 33 out of the 59 members voted in favour of the motion. 26 MCAs including those elected on Governor Alfred Mutua’s Maendeleo Chap Chap party ticket boycotted the sitting. The 33 ward representatives unanimously voted to remove Maliti in a sitting presided over by Speaker Florence Mwangangi. The Motion was moved by Matungulu East MCA Cosmus Masesi and seconded by his Kangundo Central counterpart Moses Mitaa. Mwangangi directed that a five-member committee is constituted to investigate the allegations levelled against Maliti. The mover accused the Finance minister of incompetence and failing to avail crucial documents requested by the assembly regarding management of public finances. However, as the MCAs deliberated on the motion, 25 MCAs led by Kangundo West MCA Titus Kaloki convened a press conference in the outskirts of Machakos town where they termed the impeachment process as an illegality and total wastage of time. “We have decided that we will not be party to the business going on in the assembly of selfish blackmail against the deputy governor. The public should know that the debate in the assembly is about a group of MCAs who want money for personal allowances and trips but have refused to pass the County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP) and development budget for the benefit of Wananchi,” said Kaloki. On Tuesday, governor Alfred Mutua said the impeachment motion was a mere blackmail by its mover and the powers behind him. “The latest move attempting to impeach the CEC Finance is an open and well-choreographed script to undermine and stall the operations of the governor,” Mutua said.
