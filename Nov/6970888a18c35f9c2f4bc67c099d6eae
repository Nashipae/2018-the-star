Chinese tiles manufacturer KEDA Ceramic has invested over Sh5.5 billion in boost to the government's Big Four agenda. Administrative manager Ryan Chen said in statement on Monday that the money will be invested in their Kajiado plant in two phases. "Phase three, which is projected to begin towards the end of 2019, will see the manufacturer invest another USD 25 million (Sh 2.5 billion)," Chen said. He said Kenya’s strategic position along the Belt and Road initiative has made it an attractive investment destination. The initiative was rolled out by Chinese President Xi Jinping as part of the Asian economy's interests in Africa. The Belt and Road strategy involves infrastructure development and investment in Europe, Asia, and Africa. "We, therefore, not only want to bring our products and technologies to the country but also want to create jobs and transfer skills and expertise to the Kenyan people," Chen said. "Foreign direct investments are important in the realisation of this initiative and we are playing our part in this regard," he added. During the China-Africa Summit in September, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed, among other deals, a cooperation agreement within the framework of the Silk Road Economic Belt. He also signed the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative. Uhuru on Friday, also demanded for a more balanced trade between China and Africa to fast-track negotiations to open up its market for Kenyan exports.
