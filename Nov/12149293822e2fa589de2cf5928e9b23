Media personality and comedian Dr Ofweneke says the lowest point in his life was when he was trending on social media as a wife batterer. Ofweneke says the allegations he assaulted his ex-wife, gospel singer Nicah, led him to cancel meetings with clients. "The most embarrassing moment in my life was reading stories about me on social media that I was a wife batterer. It was the lowest in my life and I even cried," Ofweneke told Massawe on Radio Jambo. "My brand was clean and I had never had controversy before. I had to cancel the meeting with a client, went home and I locked myself to cry." The comedian says their marriage lacked a good foundation, unlike what was spread on social media. "I think there were so many things that we missed when we started the marriage. Both of us had a part to play in making the marriage fail and so we don't blame anyone. The marriage was good and we got a kid together, which I really appreciate and take care of," he said. Asked if he would go back to his ex-wife, Ofweneke said everybody has moved on with their lives. He said he enjoyed the marriage in the time it lasted but will one day marry again, adding he is in good terms with Nicah. "Nicah and I are the best of friends and we even enjoy ourselves. At times I miss her and regret if we did things different, we would have been far," he said. "If I was violent, we could not be friends like we are. I make sure I talk to my daughter every day because she has provided a good platform for me to raise them with her other daughter." He said he is seeing someone else and a wedding is on the cards. "What I am sure of is, I will marry soon and I am dating someone special."
