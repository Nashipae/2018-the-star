Konza City and Huawei Technology have partnered to establish an innovation hub at Machakos University. They unveiled the partnership ahead of the Konza Innovation Ecosystem initiative scheduled for Wednesday next week. The Konza Innovation Hub will link the learning institution with the industry to improve research and innovation. Vice chancellor Lucy Irungu urged students to take advantage of the initiative. Konza architect Reuben Mutiso said they will develop world-class infrastructure and technology that will facilitate research, education and business growth. Konza Technopolis Development Authority CEO John Tanui said on Tuesday that a triple helix approach to development is key to unlocking great potential within institutions of higher learning. The concept refers to a set of interactions involving the government, industry and academia to promote socioeconomic development. “By administering quality education and supplementing skills, and with an innovative culture, we are sure to create the leaders of the future. We believe the Machakos innovation hub will be a catalyst to shaping tomorrow’s ideas and inventions,” Tanui said. Konza is a flagship project in Kenya’s Vision 2030 economic development blueprint. It will be an area of innovation for the country and the wider East Africa. The city will be a metropolis with a vibrant mix of businesses, real estate, biotechnology firms and urban amenities, bringing together individuals from diverse backgrounds.
