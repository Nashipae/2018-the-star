A parliamentary team wants the Tatu City project model replicated in all counties. The Parliamentary committee on Trade, Industry and Cooperatives said having such projects in all regions will steer the country’s economic growth and enhance job creation. Chairman Kanini Kega said they are ready to enact legislation that will support and provide a conducive environment for investors in the country. He spoke when team members went on a fact-finding tour at Tatu City in Ruiru, Kiambu county, on Wednesday. The project is being implemented on 5,000 acres. Kega said 3,000 youths have been employed in the project. “Before the entire project is completed, more than 10,000 Kenyans will have been employed. This is a great milestone in ending the problem of joblessness that has been a thorn in the flesh of our country,” he said. The lawmakers said the project is in line with the government’s Big Four agenda, especially on affordable housing. “A recent report released by the World Bank indicates that Kenya has improved 60 steps in terms of ease of doing business globally. In this regard, all the government needs to do is to create a favourable environment for investors,” Kega said. “Houses being built here are affordable as per the government’s agenda on housing. They will cost Sh3 million.” Tatu City head Nick Langford said 7,000 houses are under construction and will be ready between next year and 2020. He said the management of the state-of-art city has projected that in the next 15-20 years, 150,000 Kenyans will secure permanent jobs in the city. Another 220,000 will have semi-permanent jobs. “This city is no longer a dream but a reality. Investors are trooping in from around the world. We believe we are on course in supporting the government implement its agenda that will transform this country,” Langford said. On Tuesday a delegation of about 10 senior officials from Lagos State in Nigeria visited Tatu City on a bench-marking tour.
