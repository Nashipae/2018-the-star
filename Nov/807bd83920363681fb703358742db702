This week KDF soldiers forced some Mpeketoni residents to roll in muddy sewage, according to Haki Africa.

Over 60 people died in the Mpeketoni attacks in June 2014. Al Shabaab operatives are gradually being winkled out of the Boni forest. Security is much better now that the army is deployed and security agencies are cooperating among themselves. But that does not justify inhumane treatment of Kenyan citizens. The army needs to win hearts and minds if al Shabaab is to be permanently defeated. There is no curfew declared in Mpeketoni area. There is no reason to punish a boda boda rider working after 6pm or revellers returning home from a bar at night. And to make people roll in muddy sewage is completely unacceptable. It is a form of deliberate humiliation to ensure that the local population fear the army and obey. Senior KDF officers have promised to investigate. They should do so as a matter of urgency and advise soldiers on roadblocks that they should follow the law and respect the local population.
