Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has extended a seven-day amnesty he issued to criminal gangs to surrender illegal firearms. Sonko had promised that individuals who heed the call will get jobs and protection. The governor said those who fail to surrender the firearms will face the full force of the law. He said some criminal gangs have already surrendered their illegal firearms to police. He commended the police for dealing with gangs terrorising Eastlands residents, especially in Dandora estate. "I salute the police for doing a good job, especially after I issued the seven-day amnesty to armed criminal gangs in Nairobi to surrender their firearms. I’ll reward the police officers involved in the operation Sh500,000," Sonko said. The governor issued the call to criminal gangs a week ago in Embakasi Central constituency during a fundraiser for Harrison Karanja who is recuperating at a Nairobi hospital after he was shot by gangsters in Kayole.
