Listed publisher Longhorn is targeting more Southern African countries in its geographical expansion strategy to reduce reliance on the Kenyan course book market. The firm announced this during their 2018 annual general meeting held yesterday where it paid up to Sh115 million in dividends for the year ended June 30, 2018. “Geographical expansion remains a key pillar in our new strategic plan. We plan to deepen our presence in existing markets and to open up new ones within the Southern Africa region,’’ managing director Maxwell Wahome said. Longhorn has fully incorporated subsidiaries in Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Zambia. Through distributor agreements, the company has been able to expand its operations across the African continent to include Malawi, Zambia, South Sudan and Senegal. In June 2018, the publisher successfully completed the development of learning materials for South Sudan which covered Primary 1 to Secondary 4. “This project, in conjunction with UNICEF South Sudan, demonstrated our expertise and ability to develop innovative learning materials across the continent,” Wahome said. Good performance in local and regional markets saw the publisher post Sh183.6 million in profit during the year under review, a 38 per cent growth compared to Sh133.8 million in the previous financial year. “The company’s profitability has grown by 38 per cent largely due our commitment in implementing the 2015-2018 strategy that emphasized on regional expansion, product diversification and innovation,’’ Longhorn Publisher chairman F T Nyammo said. The company also announced that it has so far digitized over 300 of its products and availed them in various digital formats. Some of the products include interactive eBooks, audio books, video-animated stories and mobile applications.
