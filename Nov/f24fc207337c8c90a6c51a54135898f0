Afro-fusion artiste Eric Wainaina took the gay debate head-on, making some shocking remarks while delivering a keynote address at the Africa Conference For Collaborations, Exchange and Showcases last week. “A lot of our colleagues are gay. Who someone chooses to love has nothing to do with you. Concern yourself with things that you do,” Eric said. "We have to play our part in defining Africa's present and future agenda. We can’t let the agenda be decided by the conservative, polyester, oversized suit, bald-headed men." The three-day pan–African conference took place at the Kenya National Theater, bringing together music industry players from over 10 countries. At the opening of the conference Eric Wainaina was feted with the 2018 Music In Africa Honorary Award.
