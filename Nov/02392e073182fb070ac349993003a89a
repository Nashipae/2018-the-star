The Judiciary will construct over 290 new courts in a bid to make justice easily accessible to Kenyans, Chief Justice David Maraga has said. Maraga said there are plans to ensure every sub-county has a courtroom. He said many people have been suffering due to the long distances travelled to courts. Some court users, he noted, travel for hours only to find that their cases had been postponed without their knowledge. He said the new courts will be ultra-modern with sufficient sanitary facilities and will be disabled persons' friendly. Maraga spoke while launching the new Kigumo law courts on Thursday that were previously in a building that did not have sufficient space or cells, and had only one registry. He said he had a meeting with political leaders on Thursday morning and agreed to have a sitting that will categorise areas that should be prioritised in the project dubbed the Judicial "Some sub-counties will have two new courts due to the high number of cases in the area," he added. The judiciary is also committed to ensuring cases that are over five years old are concluded before the end of the year, he announced. Click here for the latest political news
