Seven people were arrested on Friday following the death of two people at a liquor store in Umoja, Nairobi. One person was left blind while another was admitted to Mama Lucy Hospital following the Thursday incident. It is suspected that the drinks were spiked with a poisonous substance. Embakasi West MP George Theuri and Umoja 1 MCA Mugambi Macharia led a clampdown of shops suspected to be vending harmful liquor. The leaders were accompanied by the Embakasi West Liquor chairman Chela Ayiro, area chief and police bosses. Mugambi said they confiscated syringes, alcohol pads, and anesthetic from the said liquor store. "Operations are still ongoing to get the main supplier of the poisonous drink," Ayiro said.
