A former Nairobi county government official has suffered a major blow after the High Court restrained him and his wife from transferring or selling properties believed to be proceeds of crime.Anti-corruption Judge Hediwg Ong’undi said the anti-graft agency’s claim is justified to the effect that if the properties belonging to Stephen Osiro and his wife Caroline Obwa are not preserved, they could be disposed of before the matter is determined.It is alleged that the two had used Sh116 million to purchase various apartments, land in Kisumu and Muhoroni. Osiro worked as a treasurer at the Kisumu Municipal Council and Nairobi City County respectively, putting him in a position of influence. The two have denied involvement in corrupt activities.
