Homeboyz forward Jeff Oluoch has resumed training with the Kenya Sevens squad ahead of the season openers in Dubai and Cape Town. He has fully recovered from the hairline fracture and the technical bench is willing to give time to get up to full fitness ahead of the final team selection “Jeff resumed training this week as he was not ready to play at Safari Sevens. He is catching up with the rest of the squad and we will see how it goes before naming the squad next week,” added Murunga. Oluoch had sensational season with Shujaa, playing all 10 legs of the circuit as well as the Commonwealth Games and World Cup in San Francisco, USA. Murunga said: “We have seen him maturing as player for the last three years. He was one of the best players last season in terms of physicality, ball carrying, scoring tries and his defence. He is a key player for Shujaa,” said the head coach. Murunga is expected to name his squad, which will feature mostly youngsters with the only two experienced players being Eden Agero of Quins and Dennis Ombachi of Nondies, who both played over the weekend. Five of the players in the team including talisman Collins Injera, former skipper Andrew Amonde, half-back Sammy Oliech, wingers Nelson Owinger and Willy Ambaka are with the Kenya Simbas at the World Cup repechage qualifier in Marseille. Missing from the squad due to injury are Billy Odhiambo (broken jaw), Arthur Owira (leg) and Eric Ombasa (ankle injury). Murunga said they have nothing to be afraid of and will be relishing the challenge of playing in Dubai and Cape Town with rookie players. “The only way the players will learn is to be put in such an environment and but this is good for them,” added Murunga
