Residents of disaster-prone areas of Lamu have urged the county to set up rescue centres as preparedness measures. They said they incur huge losses and suffer during floods, droughts and other natural calamities. Last year, many parts suffered prolonged drought spells that left hundreds of livestock dead and more than 3,000 people starving. In April-May, many parts were flooded and more than 4,000 residents were displaced. Many homes were destroyed and others marooned. Moa, Chalaluma, Maisha Masha, Dide Waride, Pandanguo, Amkeni, Barâ€™goni, Basuba and Ishakani in Lamu West are usually the worst hit. Residents said rescue centres would help them cope and avert loss of life. They said the county should store food and other items as part of its contingency plans. Those with livestock want the county to seek markets for them so they do not lose them to droughts. Last year, the national government partnered with the EU to launch a programme that enabled herders to sell their emaciated animals.
