The Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union, an affiliate of Central Organisation of Trade Union has moved to United Kingdom (UK) courts to sue tea multi-national companies that have a presence in Kenya. Yesterday, COTU Secretary General Francis Atwoli said the multi-national corporations in Kericho, Sotik and Nandi Hills have not reviewed the Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA) with their employees since 2013. The companies have also refused to recognize the Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union, which has over 300,000 workers, as a legally registered organization. Speaking during a press conference at Whitesands Hotel Mombasa, Atwoli said they had taken the multi-nationals to local Kenyan courts, but the process has been tedious. “Even when the loose in Labour Relations Court, they are prepared to move to the Court of Appeal and even the Supreme Court to lock the workers issues knowing very well in the processes of waiting for so long some workers will die, be sacked, retired or declared redundant,” said Atwoli. He said they have now decided to take the battle to the countries of origin, where the tea imported from Kenyan is highly consumed.
