A disturbing video of 10 "demons" talking about how they destroyed gospel star Rose Muhando’s career has surfaced online. Rose has been down on her luck and hasn’t released any singles for years now. The last time she was seen in public was months ago. She looked like a shadow of her former self with bruises on her feet and a bandaged left hand. In the exorcism, Rose is called to the altar by controversial Pastor James Ng’ang’a “Rose, I asked you to come here. Why are they [demons] breaking your arms?” Ng’ang’a asked. She approached meekly, ready to be prayed for. Pastor Ng’ang’a starts praying for her and she falls down in a heap of tears. “Run and go. Remove your baggage from her,” Ng’ang’a commands the demons. He then asks them how many they are and what they want. “We are 10 demons. We have said she will not sing again. If she does, she spoils for all of us,” the demons say, using Rose Muhando’s voice. After the demons run out of her body screaming, Rose wakes up and narrates that her life has been held hostage by the demons. “I was tired. For three months they took everything. I couldn’t even pay my children’s school fees. My manager told me if I go back home, I will die. They dug a hole in my house and buried charms there.” Pastor Ng’ang’a finishes off the exorcism by spraying her with something misty. Rose falls back down again and the pastor commands her to sleep. He then narrates how he has helped her. “I did not know why you called me, but when she walked into my office I knew that she is not herself,” Pastor Ng’ang’a told the congregation.
