Garissa residents and leaders have been urged to foster dialogue to improve business in refugee camps. Neil Turner, the county director of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said building resilience and sustainable livelihoods for both refugees and the host community will greatly foster co-existence. He was addressing participants at the NRC offices in Dadaab on Friday during a key stakeholders forum to discuss the business environment in Dadaab. The current Dadaab refugee population is estimated to at 208,000, constituting approximately 33 per cent of the population of Garissa county. Turner said the economic potential of this population needs to be fully utilised. “There is a lot going on in the refugee camps in terms of entrepreneur ship, whether it is by groups or individuals,” said Turner. Garissa county CEC for Trade Adow Jubat said trade has been identified in the County Integrated Development Plan as one of the pillars to spur development. He said the county was determined to create an enabling environment for trade.
