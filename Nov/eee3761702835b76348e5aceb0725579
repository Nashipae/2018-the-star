A delegation from the Kikuyu council of elders will on Monday visit the site where a Mugumo tree fell six months ago blocking the flow of Likii River in Laikipia county. Mathenge wa Iregi, one of the elders, said they will conduct a traditional ceremony at the site since there was always a special reason when the tree fell. Iregi, who has been tasked with giving offerings among the elders, said the ritual must be conducted before inviting other elders to the site. Last month, Iregi conducted a similar ceremony in Yamumbi and Lemok villages in Uasin Gishu county after a Mugumo tree fell beside a river. “The Mugumo tree is considered sacred especially among the Kikuyu community. The one that fell in Uasin Gishu had a message symbolising peaceful coexistence between the Kikuyu and Kalenjin communities,” Iregi told the Star. The elders believe when a Mugumo tree falls, it indicates an important event is about to happen. The claim is backed by several occurrences that have cemented the elders’ belief within the community. According to them, in 1963, a huge Mugumo tree fell in Thika, which led to the exit of colonialists who were fought by the Mau Mau paving way for the country’s independence. The fall of that tree had been prophesied by a Kikuyu prophet, Mugo wa Kibiru. When the British colonial government learned of the prophecy, they built an iron ring around it to prevent it from falling. In 1963, the tree split and fell in two parts, which according to the elders, led to Kenya’s independence. In 1978, another Mugumo tree fell in Chania, preceding the death of founding President Kenyatta. In 1975, a Mugumo tree fell a day before politician JM Kariuki was killed. In 2002, a giant Mugumo tree fell after heavy rains, which the elders believed led to then Opposition leader Mwai Kibaki being elected president after 24 years of Kanu rule. In February 2013, a Mugumo tree fell, which the elders prophesied to indicate the election of Uhuru Kenyatta as President.
