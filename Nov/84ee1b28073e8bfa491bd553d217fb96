Police in Migori have arrested a form three girl for drowning her three-day-old infant in River Migori. The suspect will be arraigned in court on Monday. The bizarre incident at Milimani estate comes amid national outcry over alarming cases of pregnancies in schools. The student was to join form four at Radienya Secondary in January. Villagers said the girl gave birth at St. Barnabas Clinic. “When we went to the river we found the body because it had not been washed away due to low volumes of water in river Migori,” Sylvester Otieno, a villager said. He said villagers with the help of elders confronted the girl and her family because they knew she had recently given birth. “The girl and her family tried to cover up. When we asked where the baby was they said the father came for it. We followed up with the man responsible for her pregnancy, a boda-boda rider and he refuted the claims,” Otieno said. The girl is being held at Migori police station while the body was taken to Migori Referral Hospital mortuary. “We are shocked on the beastly act, and more shocked at the family for trying to hide the crime,” Okombo said. On Saturday several leaders in Nyanza led by Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o, Homa Bay Women Representative Gladys Wanga and Nyatike MP Tom Odege called on the ministry of education to end the teen pregnancy in schools.
