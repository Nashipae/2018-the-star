City Hall has ordered investigations into the attack on a Citizen TV journalist on Tuesday, the Communications office said. Kimani Mbugua was assaulted while filming a bribe-thirsty city askari demanding cash from a boda boda rider. The incident mirrors the growing intolerance towards journalists while going about their watchdog duties. Elkana Jacob, director Governor Press Service, said the county works on a policy of zero-tolerance to corruption. In a statement on Wednesday, he said the matter will only rest after the involved officer is punished if found culpable of the crime. Jacob said the officer will be treated fairy but firmly, and, should they be found guilty, they will be prosecuted. "We are also aware that several individuals masquerade as county officials, and it is a challenge that is being addressed," he said. "The claim will be treated with the seriousness it deserves." Citizen TV noted that Mbugua identified himself as a journalist and insisted that he be taken to Central Police station but the county officers declined. Click here for the latest political news
