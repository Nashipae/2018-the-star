Don’t write off ODM leader Raila Odinga from the 2022 presidential race or you will be shocked, Likoni MP Mishi Mboko has said. Mboko on Tuesday said the handshake between Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta does not stop the Opposition chief from running in 2022. Mboko said the building bridges initiative is part of Raila’s strategy to succeed Uhuru. "Raila has gone back to the drawing board for strategies," Mboko said. She spoke at Bethania School in Likoni during a funds drive for Luo Progressive Group. Raila’s critics have urged him to quit politics after his appointment as African Union High Representative for Infrastructure Development. Raila has said he is in politics to stay. Mboko said the new job does not prevent Raila from engaging in politics. "Hold your horses. He will soon unleash his plan for 2022," Mboko said. The legislators said Mombasa governor Hassan Joho remains an option if Raila decides not to run. "Politics is like a relay race where the political baton can be passed over to Joho if Raila chooses to quit," she said.
