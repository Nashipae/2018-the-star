The high court has barred parliament from conducting interviews for National Cohesion and Integration Commission of Kenya positions scheduled for Monday. Justice Wilfrida Okwany on Friday stopped interviews for the shortlisted candidates until a case filed by Activist Okiya Omtatah is heard and determined. She certified the matter as urgent and directed the parties to serve and file responses within seven days. The case will be heard on November 26.

Omtatah says that the role of Parliament is limited to vetting candidates for the PSC or the Executive. He also says that the decision by the National Assembly to usurp the powers of the PSC, by recruiting persons for appointment as commissioners of the NCIC, violates Article 234( 2 ) of the Constitution on the functions and powers of the commission.
