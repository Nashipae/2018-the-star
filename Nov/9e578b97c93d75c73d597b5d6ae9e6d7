Migori governor Okoth Obado has urged Kenyans to pray for him, saying "there is a crocodile out to eat him alive". He said there are people who are forcing him into a crocodile's jaws. “There is this other story doing rounds about crocodiles which are not even in the Bible. Some people are pushing me into the crocodile's mouth,” Obado said. “I want you to pray for me, especially church leaders, so that the crocodile does not eat me up.” He was speaking at Kendege Technical Training Institute on Saturday when he hosted Deputy President William Ruto. The DP officially opened the Sh300 million college. Also read: I don't mind working with Obado, I don't care what people say - Ruto Obado asked Ruto to guard him against "crocodiles". He promised to work with the DP to spur development. “I seek permission from the people of MIgori to be able to walk with Ruto,” he said. Ruto welcomed the opportunity to work with Obado. They boarded the same helicopter to Nairobi after the function. “Is there a problem if I worked with governor Okoth Obado? I will not mind what will be said of our closeness,” he said. Talking about the same "crocodile", Kuria East MP Marwa Kitayama said Kenyans do not want to hear the crocodile talk (in reference to ODM leader Raila Odinga’s analogy of failed political journey to Canaan). Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro said Central region is ready to back Ruto for the top seat in 2022. “Let no one fool you. Central region belongs to the DP. We shall walk with you all the way. What we don’t want to hear are these mamba (crocodile) stories,” he said. Obado is out on Sh5 million bond after being charged with the murder of Rongo University sturdent Sharon Otieno and her unborn child. His two aides Michael Oyamo and Caspal Obiero were denied bail.
