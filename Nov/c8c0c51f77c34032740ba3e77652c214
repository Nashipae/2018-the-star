A faecal treatment plant that will turn human waste into cooking briquettes has been opened in Naivasha. The Sanivation plant will ease the pressure on the Naivasha sewerage plant and offer low-income earners another source of energy. The plant was built by Sanivation in partnership with the Naivasha Water, Sewerage and Sanitation Company (NAIVAWAS). Director of government relations Dickson Ochieng’ said the plant has a capacity of serving 10,000 people. Speaking during the opening of the plant yesterday, he said it will help to divert at least 1,800 tonnes of infectious waste from Lake Naivasha every year. “The plant will help ensure faecal sludge from vacuum truck operators and pit latrines is processed cost-effectively and safely,” Ochieng’ said. He said the plant will transform fecal sludge into biomass briquettes that would generate revenue to keep the facility running. Ochieng’ said the company had sold 300 tonnes of briquettes and as a result saved many trees from illegal logging. He said plans were underway to open a similar plant in Nakuru and expand services to two other counties by next year.
