I have my own shoes which fits perfectly well and I am encouraged by the face that Gor opted for me despite being spoilt for choice.” He added: “If given an opportunity, I will give my best shot in a bid to help them achieve their set out targets. Gor are a good team that creates opportunities for players and I know many would love to play for them. I am glad I signed up for them and justy see where I am now!” The former Tusker and Singida FC player is among the four players, who put pen on paper for the 17-time Kenya Premier League champions.
