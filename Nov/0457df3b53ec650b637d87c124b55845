Comedian JB Masanduku is currently dating and will walk down the aisle with his new catch after breaking up with radio personality Tina Kaggia. "I am in a good relationship, in which we are very open, unlike I was in my previous marriage," Masanduku told Massawe on Radio Jambo. JB said he rushed things in his previous relationship, which was the main reason that caused the breakup. "I engaged Tina after 11 days of knowing each other because the first time I saw her was when I had come to do some voice test here at Radio Jambo," he said. "We started dating as a joke and even wrote on social media. We received backlash, of course, and finally we said we needed to officiate everything. We went to her parents and we did our wedding, despite her being seven years older than me." JB Masanduku and Tina got married in October 2013. The low-key wedding was held at the Attorney General’s chambers and was only attended by family and close friends. "We spent three years in marriage and got two children together, but our marriage did not work," he said. "I am legally divorced, although at first we had agreed to do it privately without involving the court and the public. Then one day, I received a call from people asking to give me some job as an MC, which I agreed. "They tricked to meet me for the job. When I met the person, I found out it was her (Tina Kaggia's) lawyer and a police officer, and they served me the divorce letter. I had to be attending the mentions, and finally we divorced."
