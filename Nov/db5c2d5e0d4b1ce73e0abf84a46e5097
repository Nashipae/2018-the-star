PSV operators yesterday had to part with between Sh30,000 and Sh100,000 as they rushed to comply with the Traffic Act requirements. Some lost daily net revenues of between Sh3,000 and Sh6,000 after keeping off the roads for fear of being nabbed by police. Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and his Transport counterpart James Macharia on Saturday ordered a fresh implementation of the rules. The rules require all matatus to be fixed with safety belts, speed governors and have valid insurance and operating licences. The matatus are liable to fines of betwen Sh1,000 and Sh10,000 for failure to comply with the rules. A multi-agency team comprising NTSA, the National Police Service and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution has been tasked with overseeing the crackdown to restore sanity on roads. The agency, through the Inspector General of Police, yesterday announced deregistration of 64 saccos and the arrest of 2,000 drivers and conductors for noncompliance. In an interview with the Star, Martin Mwai, a driver with Walokana Sacco that operates on the Wangige-Westlands route said the costs have forced many operators to stay off the road. He said they are spending between Sh15,000 and Sh20,000 to fix speed governors and Sh8,400 to Sh21,600 on fixing safety belts for 14-36 seaters. The shortage caused commuters to walk to work as PSV operators withdrew vehicles in protest of the enforcement.This left the few operators and boda boda riders with the leeway to double their fares as demand to ferry passengers soared. On the Nairobi to Wangige route for instance, Commuters were forced to pay Sh100 as opposed to the normal rate of Sh70. Commuters from Donholm were forced to part with between Sh70 and Sh100 from the normal range of Sh30-Sh50. In Rongai, the few Matatus that were working were charging between Sh100 and Sh250 to the CBD while Matatus coming from Thika and Juja charged Sh200 instead of the normal Sh80-Sh100. More than 2,620 Kenyans have lost their lives in road accidents since the start of the year. Law enforcers have been blamed for laxity in the implementation of the traffic rules whence encouraging Matatu owners and crew to flout rules. “The police relaxed on the enforcement and began to take a bribe instead of doing their job, this was the genesis of Matatu insanity being witnessed today,” James Karimi, a driver with Transworld Sacco said.
