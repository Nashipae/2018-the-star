Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has blamed the courts for crumbling terror cases. He said his officers carry out the “best investigations” that can easily secure conviction when suspects are charged. “Who are those who have been released? Then give that question to the Judiciary. How I’m I expected to answer? We do the best investigations that we can,” Boinnet said when asked who should take responsibility for the recent upsurge in acquittal of suspects. He spoke before meeting Coast police commanders at the Kenya School of Government, Mombasa, on Sunday. In the past one year, at least 10 suspects have been freed in Mombasa alone. The courts said there was no concrete evidence to link them to the alleged crimes. “If they’re set free, it’s on the basis of the evidence adduced. But we would have done our best,” the IG said, adding they are determined to secure Kenya. “We require the support of everybody. That’s what we’ve done, and will always do to protect this country.” Read: JKIA 2014 attack suspects acquitted for lack of evidence More: Terror suspect acquitted by Mombasa court Click here for
