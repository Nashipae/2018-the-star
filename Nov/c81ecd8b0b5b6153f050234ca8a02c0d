More than 100 people received eye treatment during the Seeing is Believing medical camp in Nairobi on Wednesday. The free check-up was an initiative of the Fred Hollows Foundation in Kenya. It offered screening and treatment for cataracts and problems which are associated with diabetes. A cataract is a clouding of theeye lens. Clouded vision caused by cataracts makes it difficult to read and drive especially at night. Most cataracts develop slowly without disturbing eyesight. It eventually interferes with vision. Fred Hollows Foundation manager for Kenya Jane Ohuma on Friday said the camp raised awareness of diabetic retinopathy, a diabetic complication that leads to blindness. Many clinicians in other fields of health have little or no information about diabetic retinopathy. “We’ll continue to provide information to both patients and clinicians,” Ohuma said. He said said eye healthcare remains a challenge in Kenya with 80 per cent of the rural population having limited access. “We are working with counties to strengthen and resource eye health systems,” she said. She thanked Standard Chartered for supporting the Seeing is Believing project. Standard Chartered raised Sh10 billion to tackle avoidable blindness in seven countries, including Kenya. In 2011, Standard Chartered set the goal to raise the money two years ahead of its target date of 2020. Seeing is Believing has reached more than 167 million people, supported more than 4.4 million sight-restoring surgeries and trained more than 318,000 health workers.
