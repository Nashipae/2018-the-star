Deputy President William Ruto and Migori governor Okoth Obado hinted at working together ahead of the 2022 poll. The two spoke on Saturday at Kendege in Kuria East. Ruto was making his second visit to Migori in a week, after an earlier tour on Monday. Ruto said the same way President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga buried the hatchet, so should other leaders. "That is why I'm visiting all parts of the country, including Migori, to spread development," he said. The DP said nothing stops him from working with any leader. â€œI was with Baba (Raila) in the past, but things went haywire. Baba is now working in harmony with the government for the greater good of the country," he said. Ruto said he is ready to work with Raila and other leaders across the political divide. "Is there a problem if I worked with Governor Okoth Obado? I will not mind what will be said of our closeness," he said.

Obado who is facing murder charges following the killing of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno and her unborn baby, is out on Sh5 million bail. High Court Judge Jessie Lessit scheduled the hearing of the case on May 17 next year. The governor also faces an EACC probe over the use of Sh2.5 billion. Masara, who snubbed Ruto's visit on Monday, said he was ready to work with the DP. "I'm told you sent a message that I should look for you. I have come here to look for you. I am willing to work hand in hand with you regardless of our political affiliation," he said. Masara was elected on an independent ticket against a strong ODM wave in the region.
