Gor Mahia rookies Raphael Asudi and Eliud Lokuwam are keen to impress if they get a chance to play against English Premier League side, Everton, in a SportPesa-sponsored friendly encounter at Goodison Park, United Kingdom, on Tuesday. The two were part of the contingent that left the country yesterday morning for the host nation. The duo was promoted to the senior team having impressed in the youth team. Lokuwam joined the team last year while Asudi was promoted early this year. 20-year-old Asudi said he was ready to give it his all if given the chance saying he has been watching the Everton players on television and it will be a honour to rub shoulders with them on the field. “I am all out for the chance. I’m ready to give it my all, well aware that this is a golden opportunity that every player would love to have. Therefore I will be waiting with open hands. But all in all we are ready, as a team, to stage a good game,” said the midfielder . Lokuwam, on other hand, said they should not be overlooked. “Asudi and I are the youngest in this team but that doesn’t make us lesser players. I am ready to give my all and hopefully impress the coaches and the scouts,” said Lokuwam, an Economics and Finance student at Kenyatta University. Gor chairman, Ambrose Rachier, was upbeat ahead of the departure saying, Goodison here we come!
