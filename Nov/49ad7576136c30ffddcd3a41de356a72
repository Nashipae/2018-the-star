Songa by Safaricom launched the Songa na Milli competition and yesterday they awarded their first winner. Damaris Akinyi walked away with Sh76,000 after she guessed the sound from the song Sema Milele by Gilad. Damaris is a frequent listener of Kiss FM and she heard about Songa na Milli on the morning show by Shaffie Weru and Adelle Onyango. "I heard about the competition on my way to work in the matatu on Kiss FM during the breakfast show," she said. Damaris said winning the money has come at the best time since her family needed money to pay school fees for her younger sister, who is still in campus. She will use some of it to go to the 30 Billion Concert headlined by Nigerian superstar, Davido, who will be coming Kenya courtesy of Songa By Safaricom, KCARL Entertainment, KISS FM and Classic 105. Damaris loves the Songa By Safaricom App "because the music there sets the mood for my day, especially the daily playlists". The fact that she loves music and enjoys the app made it easier for her to win the Songa na Milli competition. Brian Chege, Songa By Safaricom's head of content and A&R, said they came up with the Songa na Milli idea as an incentive for the Songa fans. "We wanted users to join the app and discover different genres of music," he said. Brian said the competition will go on because, as the name suggests, their target is a million.
