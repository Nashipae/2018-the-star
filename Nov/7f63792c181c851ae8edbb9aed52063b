The Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam starts today amid tight security and new directives to curb cheating. The 664,585 candidates will start with a mathematics paper in the morning before they tackle chemistry in the afternoon, two days after rehearsals on Friday. The test is being done across 10,077 centres. Education CS Amina Mohamed yesterday directed documentation of each process from collection of papers to when they are returned to the safety container at subcounty headquarters. The documentation will be filed as a report and forwarded to a ministry official stationed at the headquarters at the Kenya National Examinations Council. Center managers will be required to indicate the number of extra scripts issued during collection of the papers and the time papers are collected. "This will provide data that can be used to verify any issues of shortage or missing scripts," Amina's directive says.
