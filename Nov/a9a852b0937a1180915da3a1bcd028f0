A worker at Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu's residence has been arrested for falsifying his abduction. Cosmas Mutua was taken up for questioning on Sunday over a report he made at the Kilimani police station last year. He told police at that time that he was abducted by people who demanded to know the DCJ's residence. But the police, in a statement, maintained that Mutua lied in the report filed on November 8, 2017. "There was no such incident. Cosman will be arraigned on November 5." According to Cosmas, he was approached by three people after he went shopping at Nakumatt Junction along Ngong' Road. Mutua claimed the purported abductors seized him as he was walking along Makindu road and forced him to board a motorcycle. He reported to the officers at Kilimani that the three rode to Adams Arcade before they joined Elgeyo Marakwet Road. The said report was made at the height of the 2017 repeat poll dispute which was before the Supreme Court.
