Deputy President William Ruto has high chances of becoming the Opposition leader but not President, Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has said. He told Ruto that most leaders have served as Opposition leaders before becoming head of s tate. Addressing residents at Ndere in Siaya on Sunday, Odhiambo told Ruto to hold his horses as he waits to serve as the Opposition leader during Raila Odinga’s regime before thinking of the presidency. He said Mwai Kibaki served as leader of Opposition before ascending to power as President. “Why is Ruto looking for shortcuts?” Odhiambo said. The Gem legislator said Ruto is well placed to serve in the Opposition during Raila’s presidency as he enough energy to keep any government on its toes. “We would like to have the energies of people like Ruto and his allies in the Opposition for checks and balances for the government to deliver appropriately,” Odhiambo said. He said one cannot be in the State House for 20 consecutive years as Ruto wants to “hoodwink” Kenyans to believe. Kenya is a democratic state and no one can overstay in the State House as if it’s his birthright, he said. Ruto wants to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022 and has embarked on early campaigns disguised, which he calls “development tours”. ’He has received the support of a section of Jubilee and Opposition MPs in different parts of the country. Some MPs from Central have promised to ensure the region repays the debt Uhuru owes DP Ruto for supporting him in the past two elections.They say the DP has been loyal to the Uhuru since they teamed up before the 2013 elections and they expect Uhuru to support Ruto.
