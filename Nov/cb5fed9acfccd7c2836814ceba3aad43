The Anti-Corruption Court has fined a former Education ministry human resources director Sh750,000 for abuse of office. Grace Omolo, 53, was accused of giving letters to people who had not been shortlisted for interviews for vacant posts in the ministry in 2011. On November 22, the court found her guilty of two counts of abuse of office. "The Anti-Corruption Court convicted Grace Omolo on two counts. She was fined Sh750,000 or, in default, serve one-year imprisonment," the EACC said on Twitter. In 2011, the EACC received complaints of irregular recruitment of staff in the ministry. The internal audit department had raised concern that the list of successful candidates advertised in the print media on June 23, 2010, contained 436 names of individuals who had not applied or were not shortlisted for positions. Some 344 individuals were given appointment letters, yet they were not on the list of successful candidates. "The 239 candidates who were successful after the interview were not appointed,” the EACC said. Omolo is also accused of replacing 60 successful candidates recommended by the panel that interviewed drivers. They were replaced by people who were either not shortlisted for interview, did not attend the interview or were disqualified by the panel. Click here for the latest political news
