Meru Senator Mithika Linturi is embroiled in a feud with his estranged wife Maryanne Keitany over their matrimonial home in Runda. Yesterday a court further ordered him to stay away and not to sexually harass or threaten her. Keitany is the former chief of staff in Deputy President William Ruto’s office. She is now a business woman. Last month Keitany obtained temporary orders allowing her to access their home after she claimed she had been thrown out. Senior resident magistrate K.I. Orenge had issued several orders last month against the senator, barring him from the home. The court gave Keitany the right to exclusive occupation of their Runda residence and use of associated facilities. Linturi is barred pending outcome of the case. According to the additional order obtained yesterday by Keitany, Linturi has also been barred from making any contact with her, by telephone or any other way unless permitted by the court.
