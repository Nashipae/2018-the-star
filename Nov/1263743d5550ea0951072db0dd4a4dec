By Grace Kerongo @hotsecretz/ The legendary Fela Kuti’s legacy has been kept alive by Rikki Stein, a man who is hell-bent on ensuring that the music icon’s dream and belief in his musical message and influence are never forgotten. Rikki, who left the country last night, got to watch some Kenyan acts. One in particular caught his attention—Maia Von Lekow, who performed at the ACCES music conference stage at the Kenya National Theatre. “I was ready to record Bobi Wine, but I was thinking, maybe I should do it in London or Nigeria. Then I saw Maia and her band perform. I said, ‘No’. I called Bobi Wine when I got back to my hotel room and I said, ‘Man, I found what I was looking for in Nairobi. It is just next door!” Rikki did not say when the recording will take place but he was enthralled by Maia’s performance at ACCES. “I was sitting at the back. My eyes are not that good, [but] I could hear really fantastic music. When I went backstage, I found it was a beautiful girl who was playing this amazing percussion. “I loved what she was doing. I liked the sincerity. I call it belly music.” Rikki likened Maia’s zeal in music to Fela’s. “Fela used to say, ‘I’m not playing for you, I’m playing for myself. If you like it, it is good. If you don’t like it, you gon die. You gon die for nothing, we carry you down to the police station, you die wrongfully’,” Rikki said with a guffaw. For more than 20 years since Fela’s death, Rikki has worked day and night to ensure the legend is never forgotten. His advise to up-an-coming artistes: “Be truthful. Be sincere. Don’t pretend. If you don’t know something, say, ‘[I] don’t know, but I want to find out’. Go out there and find out the answers. Talk to people. If you know somebody that can help somebody else put them in touch. Don’t ask for 10 per cent, just do it, because somebody [else] will do it for you too. Above all, learn to play an instrument.”
