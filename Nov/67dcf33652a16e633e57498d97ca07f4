North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko has decried lack of development in Nyamira, saying the county leadership has failed to deliver. Nyamoko on Sunday criticised MCAs, saying they have failed to properly oversight governor John Nyagarama’s government. "We’re concerned as leaders. We need to know who has failed to deliver on his role so that we can get rid of them," Nyamoko said. He was speaking at the Nyamira County Hall. The MP said MCAs had forgotten their mandate and were ever on foreign trips. "They (MCAs) are always on trips to Canada and the US. This is not acceptable because they were not elected to keep on travelling," Nyamoko said. He said the county cannot develop without the input of the ward representatives. The MCAs have been in a blame game with the executive, each accusing the other of derailing growth. The assembly members said corruption, mismanagement of resources and poor performance was to blame for underdevelopment. But the executive said the MCAs for derailing development by failing to fast track necessary legislation. Last month, the MCAs led by Enock Okero (Manga), said they will visit all development projects to ascertain the use of allocated funds. They cited the building of a stadium which was allocated funds yet only a perimeter wall has been erected. "The executive report says the stadium is 80 Per cent complete but we know erecting the perimetre wall cannot account for that," Okero said. Click here for the latest political news
