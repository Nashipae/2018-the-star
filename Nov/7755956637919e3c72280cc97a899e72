Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo wants the state to review its relations with China. He said on Saturday China could hurt the Kenyan economy with its huge loans.  Chinese firms have won most tenders for mega projects. The legislator urged the President to rethink the government’s strategies. The relationship must boost the economy and not allow foreigners to control it, he said. Odhiambo expressed concern over the freedom the Chinese enjoy in Kenya, saying no Kenyan can trade freely in China. "Look at the visa lifespan in China for Kenyans. It’s only two weeks and you’re forced to renew, unlike in Kenya where most of them have outstayed their work permits," he said. "We’re not saying the Chinese are bad, but we should not allow them to control our economy." Click here for the latest political news
