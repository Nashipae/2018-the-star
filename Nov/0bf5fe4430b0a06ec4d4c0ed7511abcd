STARRING: Julia Roberts, Bobby Cannavale, Stephan James, Shea Whigham, Alex Karpovsky, Sissy Spacek BASED ON: Homecoming by Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg PREMIERE: November 2  The competition in Hollywood is getting tougher by the day. More and more A-Listers are flocking the small screen to keep getting the steady pay. Of course, who can forget that small screen short films and series are mostly favoured in the awards ceremonies? And who doesn’t need an Emmy? Looks like our favourite Pretty Woman wants one to go next to her Oscar. Julia takes the lead role of Heidi Bergman in this season of Homecoming. The psychological thriller centres around a veteran facility called the Homecoming Transitional Support Centre. The centre is supposed to help soldiers who have returned home from war transition from their service life to regular civilian life. Heidi is a psychologist at the centre and, while she thinks she is working towards helping the soldiers, she later realises she was duped into believing the true purpose of the centre. When Heidi quits the facility, she ends up moving in with her mother, while working as a waitress. An agent from the Department of Defence comes to the diner where she works and questions her on why she left the Homecoming facility. Heidi chases leads to find out the truth on the real purpose of the centre. Like most psychological thrillers, Homecoming’s twists and turns are revealed after a long (I mean a really long) time. It’s perhaps how the genre works, but once you get past the dragging-feel of the movie, the show pays you back for your time. The mystery, the drama, the plot are extremely enthralling. The casts’ performance raises the production rating. Their commitment to their characters and their on-screen chemistry is simply superb. If you can stick out the lengthy time commitment the show demands, then this show is a must-watch.  Star Rating: 3/5
