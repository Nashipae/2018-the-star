NHIF chief executive Geoffrey Mwangi yesterday said he is willing to furnish documents required by police in the probe into loss of funds at the parastatal. Mwangi was arraigned alongside Finance director Wilbert Kurgat to answer to charges of conspiring to defeat justice and disobeying a court order. The prosecution said the two had refused to give investigating officers documents that will help in the investigation. However, Mwangi and Kurgat’s lawyers objected to the plea taking. Tom Ojienda told chief magistrate Francis Andayi that the charges before the court were defective because they did not disclose the particulars of the offences that the two face. He said Mwangi was not aware of the documents mentioned by the prosecution. Ojienda asked the court to defer the plea to give the prosecution time to come up with a list of the particular documents they claim have not been supplied by the two.

Ojienda said pleading to the charge will end Mwangi’s career. The two were remanded at Muthaiga police station as they await the court ruling this morning. “Any trial that proceeds with a defective charge will be declared a mistrial by the trial court,” the court heard. Lawyer Jotham Arua faulted the prosecution for bringing to court a defective charge sheet that did not meet constitutional standards.
