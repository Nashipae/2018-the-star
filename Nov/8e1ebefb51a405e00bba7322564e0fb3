Security officers have recovered more than 47 guns and arrested 30 suspects in a Turkana firearms crackdown. The seizure was part of efforts to contain banditry and rustling. The officers launched a crackdown after several residents were killed by armed bandits. Yesterday, county commissioner Seif Matata said they will not allow criminals to breach the peace. He told residents there is no cause for worry because security has been stepped up. “Turkana is now a secure region. We gave enough time for those who possess illegal firearms to surrender to the government but most of them didn’t comply,” he said at his Lodwar office. “Security officers carried out operations to recover illegal firearms, and, for a period of one year, we’ve recovered more than 47 AK-47 rifles, bullets and arrested more than 30 people in connection with illegal sale of firearms,” he said.” Last year, the government deployed more security officers to the region to restore order and end security threats. The operation followed attacks and counterattacks. Since then, killings have declined along the county’s border and on the highways. Matata yesterday said there was one isolated attack on a public service vehicle by bandits at Kekunyuk in Lokichar, Turkana South. The vehicle was heading to Kitale. Passengers were robbed of their valuables. Matata said suspected bandits had disrupted the transport system by creating fear among residents. Security officers will now be escorting vehicles from Lodwar to Kitale to protect travellers. They have also increased patrols on the roads. On November 23, the officers, with the help of residents, raided a hideout used by a gang engaged in illegal gun trade in Kalobeyei ward. They recovered three guns, a pair of jungle socks and 11 bullets. One suspect was killed. His accomplices fled but were later arrested in Lodwar. Matata warned that those found with illegal firearms will be dealt with by law.
