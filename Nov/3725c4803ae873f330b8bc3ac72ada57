The family of former Miss Tourism Nyamira County is asking for the benefits of the beauty queen one year after her death. Mercy Momanyi died while serving the county government in the department of Trade and Tourism. The 23-year-old model died at North Kinangop Hospital in January last year. Her father Josephat Momanyi, who hails from Ekerenyo in Nyamira North, told journalists on Monday that he has tried to reach the offices responsible for help in vain. “My late daughter was serving as Miss Tourism in the county government and when she died, the county government through the department of Trade promised to clear her hospital bills and funeral expenses but they never fulfilled their promise,” he said. He said every time he is told to move from one office to another, only to be told to make an official communication which he says he has done many times but all in vain. “It is now one year that I have tried to follow up with the respective offices, including Trade and Finance but I have not got any help. I followed up with then Trade chief officer Jackline Momanyi who was also very close to my daughter but in vain. She was later promoted to Finance where I have tried to reach out to her without success,” he said. The late Mercy Momanyi was supposed to be paid Sh7 million. Her father said he has not received any of the money from the county. “To my knowledge, my late daughter was doing good work representing and marketing our county in various activities and projects. I urge the county government through governor John Nyagarama, his wife Naomy Nyagarama and the concerned departments of Trade and Finance to help me and my family get the benefits of my beloved daughter,” the father added.
