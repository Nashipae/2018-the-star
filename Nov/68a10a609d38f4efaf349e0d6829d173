A teacher in Nyamira North subcounty was rescued yesterday from a lynch mob after he allegedly defiled his female pupil. The suspect was saved by administrators when residents of two villages descended upon him for reportedly defiling the 13-year-old girl. The suspect was arrested and taken to Magwagwa police station before being transferred to Ekerenyo divisional headquarters. He and the girl underwent medical examinations at Ekerenyo Subcounty Hospital as police investigated. Medical staff at the hospital told the Star that the girl needed comprehensive counseling as she appeared to be “very traumatized.” Village heads said the schoolgirl led them to the suspect’s house where she said she was forcefully detained overnight. Neighbours said the teacher stays alone. The girl’s brother said the teacher detained her overnight. She was found in nearby tea bushes.
