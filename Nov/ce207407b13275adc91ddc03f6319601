Kisumu county will host the 9th edition of the African Cities Summit set to be held in 2021. This followed the choice of Kenya as host of the edition of Africa's premier gathering of cities and local governments. The signature event of the United Cities and Local Governments in Africa (UCLG-Africa) will be held in Kenya for the second time after the first one in 2006. UCLG-Africa Secretary General Jean Pierre Elong Mbassi announced this in Marrakesh, Morocco on Saturday. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o welcomed the move saying the meeting will place Kisumu City at a vintage position to build partnerships with a wide range of state and non-state actors. "The Government of Kenya has indicated strong commitment to deliver a successful Africities Summit in 2021," Nyong’o said in a statement. "There's no doubt that towards and after the 2021 Summit, Kisumu City will not be the same again," he added. The governor also thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta and the UCLG-Africa Secretary General for the confidence they have shown in the county government of Kisumu. "We will not disappoint," the Governor said. Other cities that have hosted the Summit are Dakar, Johannesburg, Abidjan, Windhoek, Younde, Nairobi, and Marrakech. The Africities Summit is a flagship event of the Pan African Organization United Cities and Local Governments of Africa (UCLG Africa). It is held every three years in one of the five regions on the continent. The 8th edition of the Africities took place in November 20-24 in Marrakesh, Morocco, under the theme: "The transition towards sustainable cities and territories: The role of Local and Sub- national governments of Africa."
