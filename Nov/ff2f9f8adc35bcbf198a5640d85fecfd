The office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has spared legendary athlete Kipchoge Keino from prosecution over the embezzlement of funds during the 2016 Olympic games.The DPP on Friday told magistrate Douglas Ogoti that he did not wish to prosecute Keino after going through his file from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations.Keino was to take a plea on October 19, but it was deferred after he claimed in a letter to the DPP that he was not involved in the day-to-day running of the National Olympics Committee of Kenya and did not authorise inclusion of his son into the Kenyan delegation that went to Brazil. The four-time Olympic gold medallist was to be charged with allocating his son, Ian Kipchoge, Sh2.5 million for an air ticket and allowances.The DPP said the letter raised issues that were not contained in the investigation file when it was submitted for directions.Earlier, he had directed that Keino be allowed to record a further statement over the matters raised and provide evidence. The case had been pushed to December 6 for a pretrial conference. Former Sports CS Hassan Wario has been charged.
