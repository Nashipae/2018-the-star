Embattled National Lands Commission chairman Mohamed Swazuri has been granted unconditional access to his office. Justice Hedwig Ong'udi ruled that Swazuri can access his office without getting approval from EACC or NLC. The judge faulted Senior Principal Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi for directing the NLC chair to get approval from the two agencies. Ong'udi said the decision was for purposes of "making it practical for Swazuri to carry our his official duty and not earn full a salary for doing nothing". The judge ordered the NLC boss to write an undertaking that he will not interfere with any of the witnesses, failure to which his bond will be cancelled. Swazuri moved to the High Court seeking to review the bond terms issued by the Magistrate court. The court had ordered him to get clearance from EACC or NLC secretary before accessing his office. Swazuri and Kenya Railways MD Atanas Maina were in August 2018 freed on bail but barred from accessing their public offices. The two were charged with Sh222 million corruption-related offences alongside 10 public officers from the Ministry of Lands and the Kenya Railways Corporation.

The court ruled that Swazuri, being a state officer acting as the chairman of the commission, should seek clearance before he can enter his former office. The magistrate further said the EACC has to make appropriate arrangements to ensure contacts with prosecution witnesses against Swazuri are minimised.
