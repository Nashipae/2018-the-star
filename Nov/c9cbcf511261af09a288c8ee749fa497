Kilifi governor Amason Kingi's travel bag was stolen in Rome upon arrival. Security authorities in Italy on Tuesday released pictures of a man who took Kingi’s travel bag at the Leonardo da Vinci Airport immediately the governor landed. "Unfortunately upon arrival at the airport in Italy on November 17, my briefcase containing my passport and other important documents was stolen," the governor said in a statement. "The airport police reviewed the CCTV footage and indeed confirmed that someone had taken the briefcase and disappeared with it." Kingi was saved by the Kenyan Embassy in Rome which acted fast and prepared temporary travel documents so he could continue with his duties and travel back to Kenya. "I’m glad that our embassy in Rome called me today mid-morning to confirm that my emergency travel documents that will facilitate my travel back home have already been processed and are now ready," he said, "There is, therefore, no cause for alarm as everything is now fine." The trip to Rome came after Kingi held a meeting in Brussels organised by UN-Habitat to upscale the upgrading of informal settlements in Mtwapa. Click here for the latest Political news
