Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito has asked party leaders to leave MPs to decide on their own whether to vote for or against the proposed two-thirds Gender Bill without coercion. Speaking in Kakamega on Monday, Kizito said that MPs are not robots to be turned on to vote in a particular manner. “MPs are intelligent enough to make decisions in accordance to the wishes of their electorates and not individual party leaders,” he said. Both Jubilee and NASA affiliates are expected to hold parliamentary group meetings to whip their members to support the bill ahead of the vote today. The Bill requires 233 of the 349 MPs to vote it its support to pass and pave the way for additional nomination slots from the current 12 to meet the constitutional threshold. Kizito said that Parliament is “a house of representatives and not idlers”. “If you carry women to parliament, what job will they be going to do there that men cannot do? Whom will they be representing?” the MP said.
