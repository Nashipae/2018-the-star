Armed with a reputation of getting the best out of a squad, new Sofapaka head coach Melis Medo is seen by many as a man capable of steering Batoto Ba Mungu back to the summit of Kenyan football. With just two weeks before the new season kicks off, Medo is impressed with the spirit and work-rate shown by the team in his first week in charge of training. The tactician said there is still a lot of work to be done to refine the team, but noted that the progress achieved so far is huge “So far, so good and I like what I have seen in the players and the work ethic they have shown. They are getting into the program. We are just trying to build the team and work on the chemistry to know which player should play where as well know who is strong in what,” the tactician noted. “It’s a new culture and we are trying to get everyone involved. It’s one team under the same umbrella and I think it’s going to be okay.” He said he is happy with the quality of players at his disposal even as he seeks five more to complete his jigsaw. “Players are what you make of them… you shape them, you create what you require. I am looking forward to working more with them and creating a good team,” the tactician further explained. Meanwhile, Medo says he will approach one game at a time with his eyes focused on getting the team in top form by the end of the first leg and seeing where they will get at the end of the second. “It is a very tough season, compressed and with a busy schedule. We have to go a step at a time, three points at a time and aim to play good football every game,” he added. Click here for the latest political news
