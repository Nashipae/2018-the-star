Good Morning. Citizen TV journalist Jacque Maribe finally walked out of Lang’ata Women’s prison yesterday, a day after she was granted bail. Justice James Wakiaga on Tuesday granted Maribe a Sh1 million bail with three sureties. However, Maribe could not immediately go as verification of surety documents was slow. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this first day of November. EACC wants Obado croonies to return look Just days after being released from prison over the murder of his girlfriend and University student Sharon Otieno, the EACC has pounced on the assets of Migori governor Okoth Obado’s associates suspected to have been acquired fraudulently. EACC now wants seven of the governor's alleged proxies and 14 of their firms that benefited from multi-billion contracts compelled to refund Sh2 billion allegedly looted from the Migori county government. In an intriguing court battle, EACC says Obado was a beneficiary of the fictitious contracts through millions wired to his three children, most of them living abroad. _____________________________________________________ How KCAA lost Weston Hotel land The land on which Deputy President William Ruto's Weston Hotel stands was grabbed from the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, evidence shows. Senior officials at the Ministry of Lands colluded with rogue KCAA officials to take over the nearly two-acre land opposite Wilson Airport. KCAA’s manager for legal services Cyril Wayong'o yesterday told the National Land Commission that a scheme was hatched to grab the parcel in 1999. Neither the Directorate of Civil Aviation (later transformed into KCAA) nor the Transport ministry sought ownership papers. _____________________________________________________ Lawyers want Gakuo's name cleared Lawyers representing the late Town Clerk John Gakuo over the shs 283 million Mavoko cemetery scam have vowed to clear his name saying he was wrongfully convicted. Lawyer Assa Nyakundi said Gakuo was not a corrupt person and they were confident that his appeal over the Mavoko case would succeed. “The wrong person was in prison. Gakuo’s record is clean, he was not a corrupt person.  He brought sanity and order to every institution he worked in. It’s a sad thing that such a man should die in prison,” said Nyakundi. _____________________________________________________ City Hall wants to charge schools for garbage collection Nairobi County Government wants to charge schools for garbage collection after its revenues shrunk by eight per cent in the last financial year. This is a new measure proposed by the executive as captured in the 2018-2019 County’s Finance Bill. As highlighted in the bill, Day Primary Schools accommodating upto 150 pupils will pay a minimum monthly fee of between Sh3000 and Sh4000. _____________________________________________________ State banks on national land policy to smooth way for Big Four agenda "We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect." Conservationist Aldo Leopold (1887–1948) uttered these powerful words several years ago. He was deeply concerned about the speed and impact of industrialisation on the natural world. Fast-forward to today, and Kenyans are slowly decimating land with wanton and unplanned use. Skyscrapers are coming up in arable land in some counties, while industries in some have been constructed near residential areas, causing health problems. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
