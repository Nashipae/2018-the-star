The government and political leaders have been urged to set up a judicial inquiry to investigate extrajudicial killings and disappearances in the country. Haki Africa and Thirdway Alliance on Wednesday said the leaders have turned a blind eye on extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances creating room for security forces to turn Kenya into a banana republic. They said legislators, who come up with laws, are the same ones who ignore and sometimes encourage violations of human rights. Addressing a joint press conference jointly at the Haki Africa offices, executive director Hussein Khalid and Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot called for the immediate setting of the judicial inquiry to address the worrying rise of extrajudicial killings across the country. “This is a very serious human rights violation that nobody is debating. It is as if people are not disappearing and being killed. Nobody is discussing this,” Aukot said. This year, Haki Africa has forwarded 36 cases of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances to the DPP for action. Khalid said DPP Noordin Haji has sent Independent Police Oversight Authority officers to collect more data from the human rights lobby group. “Some of the investigations are complete and files handed over to the DPP while he has returned some for further investigation,” Khalid said. Aukot said the silence of the country's political leadership over the matter is worrying. He said the issue should be discussed at cabinet level and action should be taken including a possible expansion of the Bill of Rights to recognise extrajudicial killings and disappearances as human rights abuses. They said the security agencies are not serious in dealing with the killings.
