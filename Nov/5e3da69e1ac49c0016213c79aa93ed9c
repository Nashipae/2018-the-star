Busia MCAs have passed the 2018-19 budget after more than two hours of heated debate. Some 39 per cent of the Sh8.6 billion revenue and expenditure estimates have been allocated for development projects — the highest since 2013. Last year, 28 per cent was allocated for growth projects. Busia has surpassed the recommended 30 per cent allocation. The budget includes Sh50 million for the Lake Region Economic Bloc, Sh15 million for rural electrification programme, Sh1 million for road safety campaigns, Sh3 million for garbage containers and Sh4 million for green garden renovation. Speaker Bernard Wamalwa on Monday adjourned debate to allow members more time to go through the document after Nambale Township MCA Mwajuma Toloi raised objections. On Tuesday, Toloi again led opposition to the report, saying it was unfriendly. She was supported by Bukhayo North/Walatsi MCA Garddy Jakaa and Bernard Odako (nominated). Those who backed its adoption said the issues raised by dissenting members would be fixed by the implementation team. They were Bernard Papa, Julius Etyang, Jackline Mukele, George Busera, John Obwogo, Casper Ajuma, Novena Ndaliro, Deputy Speaker Lawrence Okaale, deputy Majority leader Moses Ochieng, deputy Minority leader David Luyemba, minority leader Felix Omanyi and majority leader Labaan Mukhwana.
