Industrialist Vimal Shah has recommended that MCAs should not be paid and instead volunteer their services. Speaking yesterday at the on-going Senate Speaker’s roundtable at Leisure Lodge, Kwale county, Shah said those who want to serve as members of the county assembly should be offering their experiences or expertise for free. Currently, each of the over 2,000 MCAs takes home a basic salary of Sh165,000 from an earlier Sh144,000 which had been recommended by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission before the MCAs moved to court to reverse the decision.

The size of the pie is not growing, we have the human capital and opportunities all we need to do is to reduce the recurrent budget,” Shah said. Shah also called on the government to do away market controls saying a liberal market spurs economic growth in the country. He cited the fuel and maize prices and well as commercial banks interest rates which he said should be left to the market factors to determine. He decried double taxation by the two levels of Governments and the tedious process of getting approvals in the counties as some of the challenges facing the private sector.
