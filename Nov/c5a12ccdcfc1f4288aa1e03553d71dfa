Dominion Farms’ woes have escalated even after the farm was shut down one year ago due to what officials termed as political hostility. The Siaya principal magistrate’s court on Tuesday issued a go-ahead to a businessman to auction Dominion Farm property and recover his Sh2.078 million debt. The court order seen by The Star was dated November 26, 2018, and signed by the senior resident magistrate T.M Olando. It gave Peter Otieno Ogutu, through Pambo Auctioneers, a go-ahead to auction property of Dominion Farms, a sugar grower, to recover money owed to him for a deliverey he made four years ago. The order said he company can use minimum and reasonable force during the seizure. “The auctioneers will be allowed to break into the premises of Dominion Farm should an eventuality to bar them access the premises occur,” the court order reads. No more than the debt is to be collected. The company suspended operations in November last year, leaving more than 350 workers jobless. It owes them more than Sh350 million and suppliers over Sh900 million.
