Tharaka Nithi governor Muthomi Njuki has said there is need to review the National Hospital Insurance Fund laws for Kenyans to make monthly contributions based on their earnings.The governor said the law is unfair as the difference between the monthly premiums paid by the rich and the poor are negligible.Njuki urged MPs to reexamine the law for it to be similar to the PAYE tax.“There is a problem with the NHIF formula as it is not logical for the President or a governor to pay about Sh1,700 with a monthly salary of a million plus, while a poor Kenyan, a low income earner pays Sh500,” Njuki said. He spoke during the commissioning of Kajuki Water Treatment Plant by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta.Njuki said the medical fund may be left as a preserve of the rich people if the laws governing it are not amended. “There is need to consider poor Kenyans in the rural areas, who hardly access quality medical services when they fall ill,” he saidOn the Big Four agenda, Njuki said his government, in partnership with Kenya Red Cross, is training community health workers who will be visiting people at the villages to advise them on proper nutrition to prevent lifestyle diseases.
