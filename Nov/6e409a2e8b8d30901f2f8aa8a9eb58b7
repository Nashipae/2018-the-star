President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday ordered the Ministry of Education to restore the ownership of all church-built schools. The President further directed the ministry to restore church sponsorship of schools which traditionally used to be under their care. The Head of State said he has given relevant government officials one week to finalise the process of restoring ownership of the schools to the churches. “There are many schools built and sponsored by churches. Restore that sponsorship. I have also given a week for all church owned land and schools to be restored to their rightful owners,” the President said. President Kenyatta spoke at the funeral service of Archbishop Emeritus of Mombasa John Njenga that was held at the University of Nairobi grounds.

The prelate succumbed to age-related ailments on November 4, at a city hospital. He was aged 90. The clergy and government leaders eulogised the bishop as a man who never worshiped material wealth but devoted his life to helping the poor. “He was a very social man, he had a vision of what should be done…he loved his job, he loved his God,” said Bishop Maurice Crowley of Kitale. Cardinal John Njue prayed for God to accept him. “We ask the Lord for us to uphold that which He has sent us in this world,” Njue said. Uhuru asked Kenyans to emulate the bishop’s lifestyle. Njenga was the last born among eight children and the first indigenous priest to be ordained in Nairobi archdiocese in 1957 where he also made history by baptising his mother thereafter. Archbishop Njenga served in various dioceses with his longest stay being at the Eldoret diocese where he spent 18 years. The bishop was buried at a special place at the church and not inside as was the case with Eldoret Bishop Cornelius Korir. Click here for the latest political news
