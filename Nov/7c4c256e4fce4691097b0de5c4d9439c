Vet Lab’s pair of Edwin Mudanyi and Robinson Owiti will battle it out for top honours in the Kenya Amateur Golf Championships (KAGC) series slated for this weekend at the par 71 Eldoret Golf Club. The event will be sponsored by Uasin Gishu County government. While Mudanyi, a sibling to Muthaiga pro Nelson Mudanyi, will be seeking to defend the title he won in 2017, his club-mate Owiti will be out to recapture the crown he won in 2016. Veteran Owiti is a former Kenya national team captain while Mudanyi is one of the finest amateurs in the country at the moment and a member of the national outfit. The duo have been placed in the same draw and will tee off at 7:40am, alongside Railways’ Samuel Njoroge and Limuru’s John Karichu in the four ball play. Mudanyi, who finished third during the Safari Tour Series in the run up to the Kenya Open Golf Championships in Limuru on Wednesday, said his focus is to defend the title he won last year. “I hope to retain my title. Eldoret is my home and playing here will be an added advantage,” said Mudanyi. On Wednesday, Mudanyi fired two under par 286 to finish third behind Safari Tour winner Mike Karanga of Kiambu and Greg Snow, who scooped the top two positions. Owiti, who started his golfing career in Eldoret is equally excited and feels playing on the course is like playing at home. He has thus vowed to bring back the title he won in 2016 as he plans to turn professional in January. “Eldoret is my second home and I have trained well ahead of the tournament. I want my title back as I am hoping to turn professional in January,” he added. The two will be up against Njoroge, who has equally been consistent, winning four titles in a row across the country. Njoroge has won Nyanza Open, Karen Challenge Trophy, Tea Fields in Kericho and Kenya Amateur Strokeplay Championships at Sigona to earn him a direct ticket to the 2019 Kenya Open Golf Championships at Karen.
