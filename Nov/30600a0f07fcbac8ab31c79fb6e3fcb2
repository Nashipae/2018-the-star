 Baringo MCAs who allegedly beat up their Silale ward colleague Nelson Lotela on Wednesday have said there was no fight at all. The Kanu MCAs led by Minority leader Sam Lokales told the media in Kabarnet town yesterday that they had a disagreement over who should represent the party at the assembly service board. “Lotela is just a smart comedian seeking fame through cheap publicity, otherwise nobody hurt him with a blunt object as he says,” Lokales said. The Pokot MCAs from Tiaty subcounty also said the minor squabble should not be viewed as a big issue and that the party is still strong in Baringo. Lotela was admitted to Kabarnet County Referral Hospital, saying he was locked up in Lokale’s office and beaten by deputy speaker Zelemoi and Solomon Makal (Kolowa) and Maria Losile (Loyamorok). Lokales urged members of the public to ignore the ‘slight’ commotion. He was backed by MCA Solomon Makal (Koloa) . “They know us. It is not true that we fought and if there is any mistake then it shouldbe handled by the house disciplinary committee,” Makal said, adding there were three sergeants-at-arms at the time in the house. The fight erupted a day after a motion was passed on Tuesday to disband the assembly service board over immorality and inefficiency. “Please hold me, get me some glucose, a cup of water or both, my saliva is drying up. I am also feeling hungry because I didn’t take breakfast and super yesterday,” Lotela requested in pain. Makal admitted that they had a closed door meeting that ended in a mere dispute.
