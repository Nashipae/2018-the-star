Telecommunications firm Telkom has tapped former Vision 2030 director general Mugo Kibati to chief executive officer position. The immediate former group CEO of Sanlam Kenya has also held other senior leadership positions in public and private sector, serving as group managing director and CEO of East African Cables. He takes over from Aldo Mareuse who led the company since mid 2016. Aldo goes on to pursue other interests. An electrical engineer, Kibati is a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a MSC and holds an MBA degree from George Washington University. His first degree from Moi University is in Electrical Engineering. He has held non-executive board positions in various institutions and is currently the chair of the board of directors at Lake Turkana Wind Power Limited. “The board is very grateful to Aldo for his leadership over the last three years. Notable milestones achieved during his tenure include expansion of the company’s network by over 50 per cent, successful rebranding to Telkom and rolling out of a 4G network, resulting in the company becoming the data operator of choice in the market. We wish him the very best in his future endeavours,” said Eddy Njoroge, the chairman of the board.
