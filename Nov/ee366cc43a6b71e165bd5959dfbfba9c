Hitmaker Naiboi is still bitter with some local artistes who refused to appear in his 2in1 song video, including Victoria Kimani and Avril. The singer said he has a bone to pick with Victoria Kimani, whom he says practically snubbed his request. ï»¿"I tried to reach out to Avril and Victoria Kimani. For Victoria Kimani, aliniblue-tick WhatsApp na Instagram. Nikasema sawa. Nime hold grudge kwa sababu yeye alinilenga point blank," Naiboi told Word Is. The singer, however, defended Avril and Sanaipei for their absence. "Avril told me she was going to send, but I tried calling and my calls went unanswered. For her, I believe she might have not understood the idea, but at least she told me she was going to send, which she didn’t. It was a different case with Victoria," Naiboi said. "I called Sanaipei and she told me at the moment she can’t be in such a project, unless we have a project together. That makes sense to me, than someone blue-ticking me. "I’m blaming the person that blue-ticked me. Blue tick means someone read your message na hataki kukupea time ya kuongea na wewe. Ni sawa, tutapatana tu. One day nitatosha mboga. (We shall meet one day when I will be relevant to her)." The singer has since released two videos of the song that have gone viral. "I loved the idea and I thought it was going to be great. I didn’t know it was going to be played on TV. It then grew legs and went. People asked me why they weren’t on the video and I just had to release a part two, and I’m now under pressure to have part three released." Naiboi spoke during the launch of Coke Studio 2018-19, in which he will be featuring and working on a collabo with Tanzanian star Ryvanny. Other artistes featured include Lizer, Khaligraph Jones and Alvin Kizz.
