Governor High School principal was stripped of his duties yesterday after he allegedly ferried KCSE exam materials using his car. The school is located off the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road. Its centre manager was suspended for failing to use a school bus. Nakuru county education director Isaac Atebe said the ministry will also take disciplinary action against the teacher once the exam is over. He said the government had directed that school buses be used to transport materials, but the teacher ignored this. Atebe warned other teachers against breaching regulations. Meanwhile, fewer papers were supplied to the school, prompting anxiety among candidates. Ateba said the problem was resolved and the exam would continue as planned. “There was a mix-up in the papers dispatched to the school, but this was addressed immediately after the mistake was discovered,” he said. He said the exam was progressing well. Click here for the latest political news
