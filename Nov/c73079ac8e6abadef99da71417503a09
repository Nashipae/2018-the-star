In a country overrun by singers, to catch a talent like
Meryl Paige is, more often than not, a wonder. She's quite skilful when it
comes to her vocal range, which truly complements her style of music that
involves telling aboutÂ relatable experiences. Meryl is determined to tell
her story, and move beyond the idea of being just another artiste in the
industry. Meryl has been around for a while, and she's been hard at work trying to
get her name known. You must have caught her performing live in one of the
regular exhibitions or at a karaoke show in the city of Nairobi. You might just
have heard about her, but not really seen what she's all about. Well, what we
know is that Meryl has maintained a proper attitude that finally brings our
attention to her work. Her modest catalogue shouldn't deceive you of her ability as a musician:
She's quite capable of a lot. Judging from her live performances, she's fuses
covers and her original creations into one set. From this, you can always tell
artistes who influence her sound and style: the late Michael Jackson, Alicia Keys
and Adele. Undeniably, her style greatly picks from the West, but somehow she
still manages to sneak in bits of her homeland. Her first single, "Regrets," which is now officially out on
streaming services like Songa by Safaricom, is a true reflection of her truth.
It's a melody that could lead her to the top of R&B charts in the country.
Unfortunately, she is yet to hit significant strides with her fanbase, but that
doesn't detract her from the talent she clearly has. There are plenty of good qualities presented by Meryl Paige, who continues
get the hang of the music scene. We expect she will continue to deliver
meditative, melodic songs as she strives to be considered among top singers on
this side of scope. Maybe she could change her musical approach to earn hits
that could land her mainstream relevance. Who says people can't change?
