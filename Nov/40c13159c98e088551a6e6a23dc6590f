Jubilee College students yesterday protested in Kitui town after missing their Knec exams. The students blamed the college’s management for failure to register them with the Kenya National Examinations Council. The students said Knec did not deliver the exam on Monday when the tests were to begin. They said they paid examination fees. The missed tests include those related to technical and business courses. Yesterday, the students said they were in the dark because the college’s management had not communicated. The claimed the college’s director had gone into hiding. “It is a week now since the exam began yet we have not even seen the papers,” a protester said. They asked the DCI to investigate the matter. Principal Hillary Musyoka said they will arrange for the students to sit the missed papers in July next year. “The problem was brought about by the huge fee balances. It is not of our making,” Musyoka said. Click here for the latest political news
