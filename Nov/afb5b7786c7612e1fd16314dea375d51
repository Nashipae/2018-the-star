Ulinzi Stars will face off with Wundanyi Combined at Bomu Stadium today in their second pre-season game after beating Free Town Stars 2-1 earlier this week. The club revealed they have further scheduled build up matches against Modern Coast Rangers and Coast Stima. Other friendly matches being mulled are against Kilifi Combined and Kwale Combined and to sum up the pre-season stay in Mombasa will be a game against Kenyan Premier League runners up Bandari. Ulinzi will hope that these encounters will help sharpen their players ahead of their 2018/19 season opener against Vihiga United in Mumias on December 8. The club have so far confirmed Clinton Omondi as the first dealing of the transfer window as head coach Dunstan Nyaudo moves to bolster his ranks ahead of the new season. Omondi joined the soldiers from Sony Sugar. “Clinton is a player we have been following over time and I am happy to have him. I have watched him playing for Sony Sugar and even against us, and since I was looking to add to my forward line, he is a good catch for us. He is a long-term signing and we will definitely do with his pace and understanding of the game,” Nyaundo said on the club official site. Clinton, popularly known as Aguero, was on his second stint at Sony Sugar before the soldiers coaching staff were impressed when he scored his first goal of the season in 2018 against Ulinzi Stars in February in the away trip to Awendo, which guided the Millers to a 1 – 0 win. The coach conducted trials last week to beef up the team and is expected to reveal the results soon.
