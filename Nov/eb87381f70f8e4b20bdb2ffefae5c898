Mandera senator Mohamed Mohamud has urged MCAs to ensure resources are used to benefit residents. Making his inaugural address to the county assembly yesterday, Mohamud said MCAs have a duty to guard against any form of corruption. “I urge leaders to fight against conflict of interest, entrench high ethical standards and promote the principles of checks and balances as you discharge your mandates,” Mohamud said. He urged them to fast-track past legislation, adding that pending bills are among the biggest problems that undermine delivery of key programmes and projects. He commended governor Ali Roba for “transforming the county” and pledged his support for the governor.
