Michael Kunyuga clinched the Hangzhou Marathon in China yesterday. He upset a quality field to clock 2:10:37, just four seconds shy of the course record set by Azmeraw Bekele of Ethiopia last year. Running under cool and wet conditions, a crowded leading group paced the race in the early stages. When they hit the 30-kilometre mark in 1:33:03, the leaders were cut to only 10 men. After another three kilometres, Kenya’s Douglass Kimeli first pulled away but was soon caught up by Kunyuga. After a five-kilometre see-saw battle between Kimeli and Kunyuga, the latter finally pulled clear after 38 kilometres. The 31-year-old was well on track to assault on the course record when he passed 39 kilometres in 2:00:53. But it seemed his target was only on the victory, as Kunyuga apparently slowed down in front of the line, waving hands to celebrate his win instead of keeping pushing ahead. Kunyuga’s winning mark is 21 seconds slower than his career best time set from his second-place finish in Hannover seven months ago. But it’s already the third title claimed by the efficient Kenyan, who debuted over the classic distance just last year and was competing in his fourth ever international road race. Kimeli finished second in a PB of 2:11:06, followed by compatriot Mike Kiprotich Mutai, six seconds in arrears. In the women’s category, Ethiopia’s pre-event favourite Hirut Tibedu lived up to the expectations as she trimmed nearly three minutes off the course record to take the victory. She clocked 2:25:10 to win the race. Compatriot Tsehay Desalegn finished second in 2:27:35, cutting one minute off the PB she set when finishing third in last year’s edition of this race. Sifan Melaku crossed the line in 2:31:47 as the remote third finisher to complete a sweep of podium for Ethiopia.
