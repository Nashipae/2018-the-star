The Busia county assembly has directed the Health and Sanitation executive to present a report on cemetery land in 60 days. Nominated MCA Azida Ali had requested that the executive present to the assembly copies of the Gazette notices of all the cemeteries in use, within 30 days. Speaker Bernard Wamalwa said a substantive solution would put the issue, which has gone on for a long time, to rest. "I direct that the statement be committed to the joint committee of Health and Planning. Within 60 days come back with a substantive report from the executive, including the budget-making process if there is no land, so that we solve this problem once and for all," he said. Chakol North MCA Julius Etyang’ urged the House to come up with a motion barring people from cementing graves “to allow others to be buried in the same space.” Bernard Papa (Malaba Central) supported the statement, saying people should bury their loved ones in cemeteries as the region is running out of burial land. David Luyemba (Mayenje) and Immaculate Adhiambo (nominated) also supported the call. Click here for the latest political news
