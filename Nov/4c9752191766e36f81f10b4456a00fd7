Eight Ambira High School students who claimed they cheated in the KCSE exam have been detained for seven days. The learners on Monday appeared before Ukwala resident magistrate Gladys Adhiambo but did not take plea. This was after the prosecution sought seven days for investigations. A video of the irate learners hurling insults at CSs Fred Matiang'i and Amina Mohamed after completing KCSE exams was widely shared on social media. In the clip, the boys said they had cheated in the exam despite the measures taken by the government to curb the same.

While monitoring the ongoing KCSE examinations, KNEC chairman George Magoha said the moral decay in some of the students is regrettable. He told journalists at Rangala Girls' School that if it is discovered that the Ambira students cheated as they claimed in the video, then action will be taken. "We have already prescribed what we do to people who cheat and that is what we are going to do," Magoha said. He said they will not profile any school but cheats will not go unpunished. He condemned parents for failing to raise their children with good morals under the guise of being busy.
