Ganze MP Teddy Mwambire is opposed to the castration of men who make minors pregnant. Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi and other leaders see this as the only solution to the pregnancy crisis. More than 13,000 teenagers in Kilifi are pregnant. Some sat the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education this year. Others dropped outÂ  of school. Proponents of castration want the Sexual Offences Act amended to provide harsh punishment. In a statement on Wednesday, Mwambire called for fast-tracking a task force formed by the county government to probe the cause of high teen pregnancies.
