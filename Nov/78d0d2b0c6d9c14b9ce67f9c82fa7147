 A man suspected to have stabbed his brother to death after he allegedly stole Sh50,000 from his sacco account has been arrested. Tigania East police boss Samuel Kosgey said Charles Kirianki was arrested as the main suspect in the murder of Joseph Kalaawa on November 13. He said police are following leads on transactions. "I can't confirm that Kirianka committed the offence because we are relying on the bank transactions," Kosgey said. A pastor at St Peter's Orthodox Church Irindiro, where Kalaawa was a member, has asked for quick justice. Pastor Stephen Erimba described the incident as unfortunate. The cleric said said Kalaawa may have been killed when returning home from a coffee collection centre. He said villagers torched the suspect's house, slaughtered his cattle and had a feast. "We went there, reviewed the CCTV footage and saw how he took the money from the counter. His home is now in ruins and all cows were eaten on November 15," Erimba said.
