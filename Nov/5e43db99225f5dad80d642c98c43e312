A herder was on Wednesday killed and two others are nursing injuries at Meru Level 5 hospital after a banditry attack at Lobua near Gambela in Tigania East. The ambush occurred in an area between Kiambogo and Gambela. An eyewitness Agnes Kathawe told the Star that the attackers suspected to be Turkanas shot indiscriminately killing one man on the spot. "He was shot in the head and died instantly. The others, one was shot on the leg and the other one on the ribs. They had sophisticated riffles.  They were so many. We ask the government to beef up security in the area. The Gambela police camp has only five officers. They stole 16 cows and up-to-now, only two of them have been recovered," she said.

"One route is Lobua near Mutotua bridge and Muruntui. We fear to get out of our houses because they are still within the nearby forests," she said. NPR officer who sought anonymity said the bandits are against the ongoing land demarcation and adjudication. Area OCPD Samuel Kosgei and Gambela Chief Joseph Ekotha confirmed the incident. On November 7, three KPR officers were shot dead by bandits in Kalua, Igembe Central, during a mission to recover stolen cattle.
