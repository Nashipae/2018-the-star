A book highlighting the connection between ethics, medicine and law has been launched in Nairobi. Bioethics of Medical Advances and Genetic Manipulation was launched on Wednesday at Serena Hotel and targets professional and students in the two fields. It was co-authored by Justice Isaac Lenaola and distinguished scholar Marion Mutugi. It was published by Longhorn Publishers. It looks at the explosion of medical technologies and the accompanying ethical challenges that may not be catered for by existing laws. “There are many technological discoveries emerging in the fields of medicine and genetic manipulation that are not covered by law in many countries,” Prof Mutugi said. “There is need for country-specific interpretation and operationalisation of ethical principles and norms to ensure compliance with and acceptability to specific social, cultural, religious beliefs, norms and customs.” Lenaola said the book is expected to stimulate debate on enactment and or amendment of existing laws in view of technologies that have implications on human fields. “In our country, for example, there is no law to address the issue of surrogate mothers and their compensation, and how to quantify their worth. Most poor women, especially in the slums are using wombs as rental houses, but there is no one to determine their rights,” he said. CJ David Maraga, who was the chief guest, urged legislators to come up with laws to fill the gaps as identified by the book to ensure a peaceful country. The book which has 20 chapters according to the authors took seven years to write. Click here for
