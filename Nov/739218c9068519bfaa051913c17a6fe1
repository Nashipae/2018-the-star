Harmonize has apologised to his Kenyan fans after the much-anticipated Saturday performance at Chaget Festival, Eldoret, went south, as he failed to show up. He has been psyching up his appearance on Instagram, where he posted his rehearsals, captioning: “I will be performing live in Eldoret on Saturday 3rd November. Tell a friend to tell a friend because I will be there.” However, after waiting hours for his arrival, disappointed fans were told he was not going to show up. Harmonize later posted on Instagram, claiming he was not fully paid by the organizers: "Kilichonisikitisha ni promoters kuchukua pesa za watu wasio pungua 4000k then wakashindwa kuja kumalizia payment iliyobaki na kukimbia. Hii inaumiza sana...!! (1) ni dalili ya kunivunjia heshima na uaminifu kwa mashabiki zangu (2) imeniumiza kuona watu waliojitoa kulipa viingilio vyao just for me wanadhulumiwa mwisho kabisa!!!"
