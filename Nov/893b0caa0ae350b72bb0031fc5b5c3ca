The privately owned Lesotho Times newspaper reports that the nation's MPs - who it says are already among society's best-paid people - are demanding a 100% pay increase. The newspaper reports that Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has instructed Finance Minister Moeketsi Majoro to explore a "revised salary structure" for parliamentarians. If the MPs' demands are met, their new monthly salary would double to $5,344 (Â£4,191), according to the newspaper. It says the average factory worker in Lesotho earns up to $144 a month.
