An al Shabaab operative who is serving a 12-year sentence has sued the officer in charge of Manyani Maximum Security Prison in Voi for denying him a balanced diet. Thomas Mwanzia Komo alias Bilal Mohammed told the High Court the officer, Nicholas Maswai, allegedly refused to allow him to appeal his case in Malindi. Komo claimed he was subjected to physical and psychological torture. In an application at Voi High Court on November 19, the terror convict said he has been denied communication with his family. Komo was sentenced on March 18, 2014, by a Garissa court over his links to the terror group. Maswai, who is also the Coast Regional Deputy Prison Commander, denied the allegations. When he appeared before Voi High Court Judge Farah Amin on Wednesday, he asked the court to compel the applicant to clarify if he was sued in his individual capacity or as the officer in charge of the prison. He asked the court to appoint an independent team to probe the allegations. "For fairness, the court can appoint an independent panel to investigate these claims," he said. Maswai said Komo's appeal had been forwarded to the court in Malindi. He dismissed claims of torture, saying he had not received any report. He said the prisoner was allowed to communicate with his relatives and friends whom he had called 11 times. On claims that Komo was denied permission to attend school and was segregated, Maswai said the law allows the restrictions. "The applicant is an active member of the terror group. He is reported to be looking for an opportunity to radicalise others," reads part of the response. The judge ordered that Komo be provided with a copy of respondents’ submissions and file a counter response within in 21 days. The case will be heard on January 30, 2019.
