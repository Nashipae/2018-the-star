Music producer Tedd Josiah has admitted to being the reason his first marriage did not work out. "I was young and stupid when I married my first wife. I was so arrogant and at that time I was not ready to marry," Tedd recently told Massawe on Radio Jambo. "I played a part in making sure the marriage did not work. I was a really bad boy." Tedd explains how lonely he was after neglecting his children from former wife. "Losing the kids was so painful. I had another daughter who kept waiting for me at the gate every day but I was nowhere to be seen. That wound is still very fresh, but now is when we are trying to repair the bond that was broken then with my other two children," Tedd said. The reason he posts his daughter so much on social media is to express all the love his other children lacked from him, he said. Tedd Josiah lost the mother of his daughter, Reginah Katar, a year ago. Katar was his second wife. "All the love that my other two children did not receive I decided to give to Jay, and all the mistakes that I did should not be repeated. It is a second chance that God has given me." Asked if he would go back to the wife of his two children, he said: "Once the marriage broke I had a lot of time to reflect. I realised I needed children and I was so lonely. Sadly I can't go back to my first marriage, because there is no chance for a reverse wheel in my life. We had differences that we can never solve," he said. His advice to married men is: "If you know you are doing wrong things, they will ruin your marriage. Build your empire as husband and wife and not for people to see you but for generations to see in future."
