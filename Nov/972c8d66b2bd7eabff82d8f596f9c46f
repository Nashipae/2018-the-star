Champions Kenya Police will be seeking to move to joint top of the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League standings when they visit Nakuru Hockey Club today. The law enforcers will seek to show that their 16-2 win over Wazalendo was no fluke as they seek to close the gap between them and Butali Sugar. Police have 48 points, three shy of the sugarmen, who have played a match more and the defending champions will aim to capitalise on their opponents’ poor run, which has left them third from bottom. Police could be level with Butali as of now but the league management are yet to uphold the win after Wazalendo filed a complaint for alleged biased officiating. However, the law enforcers will look to put all the controversies at the back of their minds and get on with the business of the day like professionals. Meanwhile, struggling Western Jaguars will rely on home advantage when they host Nairobi Sikh seeking to unhook themselves from the jaws of relegation. Jaguars sit rock bottom of the table with 15 points and will have to win all their remaining three matches and hope that the three teams above them falter to keep their hopes of another season in the topflight alive. Sikh, who last won the league in 2012, are also at risk of relegation despite being placed seventh with 20 points. At City Park, Badgers will be hoping to continue with their second leg surge when they accost Greensharks. Badgers are unbeaten in the second leg and sit ninth with 20 points, nine behind their opponents, who are third. Tomorrow, it will be a battle of students as JKUAT battle USIU- ‘A’ Spartans at City Park in the sole ladies tie of the weekend. JKUAT sit second from bottom with seven points and will be hoping to move a place higher
