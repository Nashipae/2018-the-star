A Baringo MCA is nursing injuries in hospital after he was beaten up by his colleagues during a stormy assembly session on Wednesday. Silale ward's Nelson Lotela was rushed to Baringo county referral hospital after he was attacked by colleagues. The fight was sparked by differences following disbandment of the county public service board. The assembly had earlier disbanded the board over what it termed as gross incompetence by its members. Normal assembly proceedings were halted following the incident.

He said Lotela, who supported the motion to disband the board, was forcibly led to a room by three MCAs who locked him up and attacked him. "They locked the room before beating him. We had to break the door so that security officers could gain entry and rescue him,” Kipchumba said.
