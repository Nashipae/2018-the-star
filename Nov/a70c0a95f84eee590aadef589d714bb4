National Health Insurance Fund boss Geoffrey Mwangi spent his fifth night in a police cell as the DPP told court he should only be released on a Sh50 million bond. Mwangi was arrested on Friday afternoon alongside NHIF finance boss Wilbert Kurgat for refusing to hand over documents to the police in the probe into Sh2 billion lost by the insurer. Yesterday, prosecutor Alexander Muteti requested for strict bond terms in case the court will dismiss their application to nhave them denied bail. He said this would send a strong message about the war on corruption. The prosecutor had earlier proposed Sh5 million bond or Sh3 million bail each before he later raised it to Sh50 million. He also sought to have them blocked from accessing their offices or posting details of the case on social media. Defence lawyer Jotham Arwa said the charges are misdemeanours and requires bond terms of Sh200,000-500,000. Chief magistrate Francis Andayi directed that the  suspects be detained, pending today’s bail ruling.
