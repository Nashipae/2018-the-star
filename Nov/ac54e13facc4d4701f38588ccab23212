Gender and Youth CS Margaret Kobia has urged women to support each before calling for equality. She said on Wednesday that many women are not in leadership positions because they do not get support from one another. Kobia spoke during the launch of the Democracy Trust Fund in Nairobi. The fund has been set up by Echo Network Africa in partnership with the government. It will finance women, especially those seeking elective posts. It encourages them to save cash for campaigns. Only unity of purpose will enable women to achieve the two-thirds gender rule and inclusion of those with no opportunities, Kobia said. She said making this happen is complex and requires concerted efforts and advocacy. “Given the sociocultural environment we live in, leadership in many spheres of life has tended to be elusive to women and skilled towards men,” she said. The CS said women seeking elective posts suffer from financial constraints, violence and discrimination. “When people talk of a leader, they think of a man. That’s why we’ve launched the Democracy Trust Fund, which will help women aspiring for leadership roles. When the idea is good, resources are not a problem,” she said. Echo Network CEO Jennifer Riria said the fund will not only focus on politics but also leadership positions in other fields.
