Boys and men who make school going girls pregnant should be hunted down and arrested, Kitui cleric Julius Nyerere has said. He decried the high number of KCSE candidates who are pregnant. Nyerere, who heads the Messiahship Church in Mwingi, said the authorities should show no mercy to the people who have impregnated the 113 girls. His statement came as county  director of education  Salesa Adano  clarified  that the  actual  numbers of  candidates  who  had  given  birth during the examination season was 41.  Seventy-two girls are still pregnant. Nyerere said  the  number of  pregnancies was  not only alarming, but amounted to a serious criminal offence.  He faulted parents for not speaking out once they discovered the girls were pregnant. “It is bewildering that it was not until examination time that we learned of the high number of girls being pregnant. This culture of silence of parents while their children’s lives are being ruined must come to an end,” Nyerere said.“It’s high time chiefs  and their assistants hunt down the culprits.”
