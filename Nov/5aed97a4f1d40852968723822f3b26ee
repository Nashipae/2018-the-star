Questionable financial expenditure at the Agriculture ministry has returned to haunt Health CS Sicily Kariuki four years after her departure as the accounting officer. A parliamentary watchdog committee has recommended investigations into billions spent in 2014-15, when Sicily was the Agriculture Principal Secretary.Top on the list is Sh2.1 billion the ministry purportedly wired to the scandal-ridden National Cereals and Produce Board as subsidy for purchase of fertiliser to be sold to farmers.The PAC says no verifiable documents have been produced to confirm the actual quantity of fertiliser bought by the NCPB, as well as the quantity sold to farmers.The ministry is also unable to prove the price at which they bought the fertilisers and how much they sold to farmers.

In addition, and despite our request for management to produce tender documents and correspondences relating to the disqualified bidder, no documentation was availed,” the PAC said.The committee wants anti-graft investigators to get to the bottom of the tendering process.During Sicily’s tenure, the ministry also paid Sh400 million to Kenya Seeds Company Ltd, purportedly to subsidise sale of seeds by the company to farmers.  However, a staggering Sh300 million was not supported by payment vouchers and other relevant documents to confirm that payment was indeed made.The watchdog committee says anti-graft investigators must begin probe into this matter within three months after adoption of the report.Also in contention is Sh25 million direct procurement awarded to a Dutch firm for the importation of certified potato seeds.The committee dismissed the reasons provided by the ministry for using restricted tendering as non-convincing and unjustifiable in law.According to PAC, there was no written approval of the ministerial tender committee as required by law.
