The government has postponed the
planned registration of more than 2.5 million farmers
until next year. North Rift governors have, however, resolved to support
registration of genuine farmers to deal with cartels
who interfere with the NCPB and other agricultural
institutions. Council of Governors chairman Josphat Nanok
wrote to the Agriculture ministry over the planned
registration after a meeting with his colleagues in Eldoret
last week. They agreed to support the drive. “We fully support the registration and urge that it be
expedited so support programmes in the agriculture
sector benefi t genuine farmers, not cartels that have
been frustrating farmers,” the letter said. Officials from the ministry said they were still preparing
a system through which the farmers would be
enrolled. Governors Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu),
Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet) and Patrick Khaemba
(Trans Nzoia have warned that most farmers could
abandon maize farming if the cartels are allowed to
run roughshod over the sector.
