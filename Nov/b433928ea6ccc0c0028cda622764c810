Men who impregnate school girls should be castrated, youthful legislators have said. The MPs, Senators and MCAs younger than 35 years on Friday said they will push for stiffer penalties for the culprits. "There is no need for any task force. What for? They should be castrated," said Murang'a woman representative Sabina Chege said. She spoke after they met at Serena Beach Hotel in Mombasa. Nairobi senator Johnson Sakaja said it is a shame 30 per cent of girls in Kenya get pregnant before reaching 19 years of age. "That says a lot about our value system. We are a rotten society," the Senator said. He said more youth need to be included in the conversation about the Universal Health Cover. Sakaja noted that the youth make up 70 per cent of the Kenyan population and thus no conversation about the Big Four Agenda should be held without prioritising the youth. Ganze MP Teddy Mwambire and his Likoni counterpart Mishi Mboko said banning disco matangas is not a solution to the problem. "This is an issue that only hurt the entertainment industries. Even when you ban disco matangas they will do it somewhere else if you don't fix the system," said Mwambire. The Ganze MP said underage people engage in sexual activities even in churches. "After Christian keshas, you find condoms strewn all over. Do these people pray with condoms?" he posed. Click here for the latest political news
