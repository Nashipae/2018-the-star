Thwake Inter-county Consultative Forum formed to oversee the construction of Thwake multipurpose dam now wants half of the 30 per cent contracts shelved for Kenyans to be awarded to the Ukambani-based contractors. In a consultative meeting in Wote town on Monday, the committee members said the recommended three per cent was too little. "We have agreed that of the 30 per cent contracts that should go to Kenyans, 50 per cent should be awarded to contractors from this region," Makueni governor Kivutha Kibwana said. He said this will translate to about Sh5.5billion of the SH11 billion that is supposed to go to the Kenyan contracts. The government is expected to provide 65 per cent of the financing, and the African Development Bank contributes the reminder. The dam will cost Sh64billion. Kibwana said that they were also demanding that 60 per cent of the 80 per cent jobs that should go to Kenyans be sourced from the Ukambani region. His sentiments were echoed by Machakos governor Alfred Mutua, who in addition said hey will not allow brokerage in the awarding of the contracts. "We do not want these contracts to go to brokers, whose interest is to sell them to non-locals. We will work very closely with our MPs, MCAs and any other elected leaders to ensure those who get the contacts have the capacity to do the work," Mutua said. He said that apart from water supply, they are also looking forward to ensuring the dam is of economic benefit to the region. "We want to ensure before the dam is even completed, our people make as good money as possible. With that money in circulation, then our region will grow economically," Mutua said. The two Governors also asked the National Treasury to fast truck the release of the monies made for the compensation of the remaining 189 persons affected by the project. Kibwana said they had information that all the necessary signatures approving the payments had been made but the monies were stuck at the Treasury.
