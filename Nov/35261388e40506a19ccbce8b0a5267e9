Rampant national Under-23 football team, Emerging Stars launched their quest for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics with an impressive 5-0 win over Mauritius in the first leg of the preliminary opening round yesterday at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The match, which also serves as a qualifier for the Africa Under-23 Cup of Nations saw Stars set one foot into the second round as they only need a draw in the return leg on Sunday in Mauritius to go through. If successful, Emerging Stars will face the winner between Sudan and Seychelles. Stars were untested in the opening half and were in charge from the onset with Ovella Ochieng making good use of his sprinting talent to torment his marker Gukoola Neelesh before supplying quality crosses which were met with an equal reaction. The home side’s goal hunger was rife with Pistone Mutamba and Ovella missing clear cut chances in the opening 10 minutes of the game. Omurwa gave the home side the lead barely 13th minutes into the match from Yusuf Mainge’s corner. He headed home a bullet which caught the custodian Alexandre Figare flat-footed. The Kenyan youngsters continued with their quest to double the scores and at the stroke of half an hour, James Mazembe headed home the second after a quick counter-attack by Ovella found a unmarked Teddy Osok at the right flank and the former Gor Mahia man floated a cross, which Mazembe superbly dived to hand Kenya the second goal. Kenya carried the two-goal lead into the breather and upon resumption, Kimanzi withdrew a ineffective Chrispinus Onyango for Sharks’ forward Sydney Simale as he sought to get a bigger winning margin. Barely two minutes into the final half, Ibrahim Shambi thought he had given Kenya the third goal but watched his effort from the box hit the woodwork with the keeper well beaten.
