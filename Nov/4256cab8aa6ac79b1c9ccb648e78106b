Six voters have sought court orders stopping cash withdrawals from Trans Nzoia county government accounts. Citing grounds of theft of funds, the six, through lawyer Jackson Wekesa, accuses the county leaders of conspiring to steal public money. They have named Governor Patrick Khaemba, ex-finance executive Maurice Lokwaliwa, ex-chief officer Ben Wanjala, head of treasury Caroli Nanjale, and the county as respondents. The applicants have sworn an affidavit stating the Auditor General's report for the financial year 2016 reported a loss of Sh8,201,333 at the county. The petitioners are Moses Wanyonyi, Morris Amesa, Charles Khamala, Lucas Wanjala, Magaria Gregory, and Stanley Mwangi - being registered voters in Trans Nzoia. The application also states that an audit of the county accounts showed a massive loss of public funds occasioned by the respondents through phantom projects. "The projects have not commenced to date and there has not been any explanation as to why this is the case," Wekesa said. He said that the reported loss of public funds from phantom projects comes to more than Sh65,343,004. Wekesa told Justice Hillary Chemitei that the respondents have acquired and own many properties in Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, and Nairobi counties. "Unless this court intervenes and issues the order sought herein, the 1st to 4th respondents will continue to pilfer public funds at will and with wanton impunity." The lot has also cited the proposed construction of the main Kitale Bus park and market as some of the questionable projects. The petitioners also want the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to undertake lifestyle audits of all the first four respondents. Justice Chemitei said the case will be heard on January 23, 2019.
