A key suspect in Monica Kimani's murder was on Monday released from custody pending the hearing of the case. Recce Squad officer Jennings Orlando Odhiambo was set free after the inspecting officer dropped an application to continue holding him. Police had been given 14 days to detain him as investigations continue. Kiambu Senior Principal Magistrate Stella Atambo, however, directed Odhiambo to be reporting to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations every Wednesday until hearing resumes on January 7, 2019. The prosecution told the court that Odhiambo is likely to turn state witness in the case upon completion of investigations. Odhiambo has been linked to the September 19 gruesome murder of Monica in her apartment in Kilimani. He is a friend to Joseph Irungu alias Jowie, the key suspect in the murder. Irungu’s fiancée Jacque Maribe is out on bail over the same crime. Detectives said CCTV review showed that Odhiambo was on the passenger seat of Maribe’s car when Jowie was seen driving into the compound that houses Monica’s apartment the night she was murdered. Monica’s body was discovered the following day in a bathtub with her throat slit. Read: GSU officer arrested as Kimani killing plot thickens Click here for the latest political news
