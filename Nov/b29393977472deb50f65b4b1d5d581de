He argued the actions and conduct of the commission amount to economic sabotage and is aimed at crippling him financially. "The total invasion of our clients properties by the EACC and the manner in which the evaluation and search is being carried out is a total infringement of his privacy," Orengo said. He said all the 58 properties EACC listed in court were acquired before he became a state officer upon election to the office of governor of Nairobi county in 2013. The EACC, he said, has no justification in forcibly entering the properties and disrupting businesses carried thereon on the claim of investigations. Click here for the latest political news
