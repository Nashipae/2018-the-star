Some patients are forced to sleep on the floor at Kisumu County Hospital due to a shortage of beds. Investigations at the hospital on Tuesday night also revealed patients are forced to share mattresses on the floor, while others shared beds. Some patients who sought anonymity said they had been sleeping on the floor for the past three days. Kisumu Residents’ Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada accused county government of failing to address patient congestion at hospitals. He called allocation of Sh200 million to set up a bank under the Lake Region Economic Bloc (LREB) a misplaced priority. “Why is the county government pumping Sh200 million to LREB while patients are sleeping on the floor in health facilities?” Ogada asked. He said they are not against the bank but the health sector should be given a higher priority. “It is very unfortunate that our women and children are forced to sleep on the floors. We need to focus on better health servicies. Ogada accused the county health officials of laxity and incompetence and asked Governor Anyang Nyong’o to personally make impromptu visits in hospitals to establish the real problems. The governor should not rely on reports from county health officials and should see for himself, the Resident’s Voice official said. ‘petty wrangling’ Ogada urged the county health assembly committee to effectively perform their oversight role. “Residents are not interested in petty wrangling among the MCAs. All we want is for them to ensure proper service delivery,” Ogada said. Kisumu hospitals have been on the spot over bed shortage and negligence. The congestion has largely been blamed on the high number of accident cases in Western Kenya. On September 18, Deputy Governor Mathews Owili said they working on ways to manage patient congestion at the health facilities.
