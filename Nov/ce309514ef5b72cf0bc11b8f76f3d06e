Four suspected cattle rustlers were killed by Korrompoi residents in Kitengela on Friday, while one escaped with gunshot wounds. Their truck was razed. Herder Kunini Mwanta said the suspects went to his home in Kaputiei North ward on Friday morning and stole nine cows and a bull. “After the suspects had driven off the cows, my dogs continuously barked and my sons went to check and found the cows missing. They immediately raised the alarm and the rustlers were pursued,” he said. Mwenda said the cows were taken towards the Export Processing Zone in Athi River, where the rustlers wanted to load them onto the truck. The rustlers were caught and a shooting ensued, with one suspect escaping. Isinya OCPD Kinyua Mugambi confirmed the incident and said the four suspects were confirmed dead on arrival at hospital. Witnesses said some of the villagers were armed with licensed guns and that there was no resistance from the rustlers. Two weeks ago, Kitengela OCS Renson Gambo said he would deal with gangs and cattle rustlers causing mayhem among pastoralists in Korrompoi.
