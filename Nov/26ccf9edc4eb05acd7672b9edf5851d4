President Uhuru Kenyatta has asked the Kenya Defence Forces to modernise and diversify its training in order to master the country’s security environment. Uhuru said KDF soldiers must have the knowledge to anticipate emerging security threats against the country. He said it was only through good training that KDF will be able to keep the country safe. "We have already anticipated the forces of terrorism, radicalization and violent extremism. Indeed we have met them in the field and what remains is to defeat them and secure Kenya and our region," Uhuru said.
