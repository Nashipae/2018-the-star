Makueni senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr wants the Building Bridges taskforce to fast-track collection of  views from Kenyans and present the report to Parliament for adoption in record time. Speaking in Makueni on Friday, Mutula said the referendum should be fast-tracked if proposals by Kenyans amount to constitutional amendments. “The latest we should have a referendum is 2020 to give the Legislature ample time to come up with relevant laws,” Mutula said.“The referendum questions should be simple and straight forward for the electorate to understand and vote for the changes,” he added. He said elective posts should be reduced to ease the burden on taxpayers. “The presidential election should be separated from other elections to avoid repeated disagreements that have been witnessed after every five years in the country,” he said. Makueni residents said the government should commit to fighting corruption, recovering resources stolen from the public and punishing corrupt government officials. “Measures taken to fight corruption should be punitive to discourage others from getting involved,” a resident, Gideon Mulili, said. They said criteria used to allocate resources to counties should be reviewed, blaming skewed allocation and plunder of government resources for negative ethnicity and cyclic post-election violence. “Ethnic antagonism is brought when some Kenyans feel left out. We should strive for inclusivity and equity to bring harmony and peace in the country,” Mulili said. Former Nguumo MCA John Mwenze said current parameters used by Commission on Revenue Allocation were unfair and widened the gap between the rich and marginalized counties. He said equal distribution of resources would bring reconciliation that would foster unity and development in the country.
