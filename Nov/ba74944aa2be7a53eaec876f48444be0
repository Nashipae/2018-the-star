The Garissa county government has assured small-scale businessmen of a level playing field amid fears of favouritism in allocation of resources. Trade CEC Adow Jubat said that they were committed to empowering small-scale businesses to improve the county’s economy. Speaking on Friday at the Garissa bus park, Jubat sought to dispel rumours that outside traders would replace local traders during allocation of market space. “I want to give assurances that there will be no monkey business in the allocation exercise. All beneficiaries are already known,” Jubat said . Recently governor Ali Korane who toured Qorahey market said that the county planned to relocate the traders from the roadside to new stalls at the market. Jubat said that plans to fairly distribute markets pace would extend to the other subcounties to accommodate all traders. On Monday, Jubat said the county would also map out all businesses to improve planning and services. He said the mapping will also help improve the sewerage system and provide social amenities. He said he regretted that the traders’ welfare had been neglected for too long. “We can only address these problems by putting together all data of businesses in the county. We want businesses to operate in a clean environment with proper sewerage systems,” he added. The mapping decision was reached after officials from his department met the business community and the Chamber of Commerce two months ago. The mapping data will be available at the county website and a directorate created to provide information to potential investors.
