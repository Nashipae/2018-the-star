According to the police report, the shooting incident occurred at Thindigua area, about 100 metres from Thindigua police post, where police constable Evanson Busienei was shot dead at 12.10am while walking back to the police post. The officer was shot by Duncan Maina who is attached to DCI headquarters. Maina alleged the deceased who was with another man, stopped him and demanded to be given the vehicle he was driving - a white Toyota Corolla KAU 429U- which belonged to the DC headquarters. The constable advanced towards Maina warning him that he would pull the trigger. This prompted Maina to stop the vehicle and draw his pistol, shooting Busienei at close range. Maina then alighted from the vehicle and fired several rounds at the direction of Busienei’s companion who disappeared towards a construction site. The officer also shot at a nearby Land Rover, KBY 037Z, where four other men were standing, forcing them to flee.
