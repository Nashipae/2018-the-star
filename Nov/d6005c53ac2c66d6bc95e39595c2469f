Three Wajir officials were charged yesterday with embezzlement of Sh26.1 million. Finance executive Daud Abdulahi was charged alongside county secretary Ahmed Omar and acting head of treasury and economic advisor to the governor Jeff Kithinji. Also charged was KCB Wajir branch manager Siyad Ahmed. Abdulahi was also charged with abuse of office and willful failure to comply with the law on the management of public property. Abdullahi is accused of improperly conferring the Sh26.1 million to Kithinji. He was accused of designating one authorised signatory in respect of the county government imprest account instead of the mandatory two. Omar also faced similar charges. Kithinji was charged with raudulently acquiring public property. The suspects denied the charges before Milimani chief magistrate Douglas Ongoti. They were released on a Sh1.5 million bail each and directed to surrender their passports. The case will be mentioned on December 10. Click here for the latest political news
