Police in Homa Bay have arrested three people who robbed a woman of Sh8,000 and other personal effects on Katito-Homa Bay road. Fredrick Onyango, Ishmael Obongâ€™, and Stephen Obonyo were rounded up at Nyangweso market in Rangwe constituency on Monday. They reportedly robbed Helga Mugisa after she boarded a private car at Katito, having missed a matatu to Homa Bay town. The three were on board. Mugisa told the police the three stopped the car at Kadel in Karachuonyo constituency, ransacked her luggage and took away her valuables. The woman further told the police that she sustained injuries after she was roughed up during the Sunday incident. "I was ordered to lie down on the back seat before surrendering all I had. They took my money and phone before abandoning me by the road." County police commander Marius Tum said they arrested the suspects, said to be terrorising residents, after tracking the woman's phone. "We recovered the victims' phone, several identity cards, a kitchen knife, and a masking tape," Tum said. "We expect the suspects to reveal their accomplices who we believe conduct gang activities on the said route," the police boss said. Click here for the latest political news
