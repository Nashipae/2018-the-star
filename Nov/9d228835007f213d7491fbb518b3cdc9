Residents of Kimondis location, Baringo county on Monday protested over the appointment of an assistant chief whom they termed as a foreigner. The residents complained that the assistant chief, Nancy Kalum, was not one of their own and was only married to Victor Kiptai, a villager from the neighbouring Ketemwo sublocation barely two months ago. “This is Kibingor sublocation and we wonder how Kalum, from another village, found herself here as our new assistant chief, yet we presented a list of 17 qualified applicants for the job,” Blair Kulei, a resident, said. He said that the appointment was a clear indicator of nepotism and corruption which they would not accept. “We want the entire process scrapped to allow a free and fair procedure,” Kulei said. He questioned the criteria used by the government to eliminate the other candidates who the residents said held degrees and diplomas from the area only to hire a non-resident who only had a secondary school certificate. The angry residents matched to Kibingor trading centre carrying twigs and placards chanting slogans calling for the EACC to probe the appointment of Kalum. They appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to intervene over the matter. However, when contacted, Baringo county commissioner Henry Wafula denied having knowledge on what transpired during the chief’s hiring process.
