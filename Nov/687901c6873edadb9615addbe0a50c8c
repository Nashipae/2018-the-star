STARRING: Damon Wayans Jr, Amber Stevens West, Stephnie Weir, Victor Williams, Chris Parnell, Felix Mallard GENRE: Sitcom RELEASE DATE: October 1  Jake and Claire are a happy couple in their 30s. Their favourite way to spend a Saturday night is watching TV shows while eating junk food. While watching TV, Jake and Claire see on the news that Cooper James, a young, famous popstar from Australia, has broken up with his girlfriend. Since Jake is Cooper’s tax accountant, he is sure the break-up will not affect him in any way. A knock on the door proves him wrong. Cooper informs Jake and Claire that his break-up has caused a huge media frenzy, and the only place he could run to, which no one will find him, is the Suburbia.  He ends up staying with Jake and Claire until the whole mess blows over. Jake and Claire are forced to give up their boring lifestyle for a much younger excitable one when they accompany Cooper to a night club. Cooper is accidentally photographed with Claire with the paparazzi claiming that Claire is Cooper’s new girlfriend. This makes Cooper’s ex-girlfriend Sierra return to Cooper’s life. Cooper realises that he likes the simple life of living in the suburbs and requests Jake and Claire if he could stay with them on a more permanent basis. The odd roommate dynamic turns out to be useful to both parties. Happy Together does not bring anything new to the table. It avoids all the complexities necessary in making a show a great hit. It is just a simple show that provides pure enjoyment for 30 minutes. The show is a great wind-down to a long day. Although the material and jokes are nothing new, the actors’ dynamic on-screen interaction is nothing short of pure chemistry. They are the reason why the audience keeps coming back for more.  Star Rating: 3/5
