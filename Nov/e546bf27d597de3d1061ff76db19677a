The fresh petition by former Kakamega senate aspirant Seth Panyako was received by the Clerk of the National Assembly on Monday last week and is due to be discussed by the Justice and Legal Affairs committee anytime from now. The petition seeks to have Chebukati sent home for allegedly engaging in an illegality during last year’s polls. _____________________________________________________ Cash wars rock NASA coalition A fresh money row has erupted in the National Super Alliance after ODM, Wiper withdrew financial support. The situation poses a serious unity test to the opposition outfit. In a move that is likely to spell death sentence to the biggest political coalition in the country, two major NASA’s political parties have withdrawn their members’ contribution to the coalition and instead directed that the money is channelled to the individual party’s coffers. _____________________________________________________ Mum who killed brother over lover gets 5 years A single mother of five who killed her brother for trying to stop her love affair with an Akorino man has been sentenced to five years in jail after she pleaded guilty.
