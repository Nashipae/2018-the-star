The Governor of the Central Bank Dr. Patrick Njoroge was very forthright in is rebuttal of the IMF who had previously classified the Shilling from “floating” to “other managed arrangement” to reflect the currency’s limited movement due to periodic Central Bank interventions and pronounced it overvalue by 17.5% On the 06-NOV-2018 I wrote that The finding that the Shilling is 17.5% overvalued is alarmist and not borne out by facts. The Governor said The shilling could be overvalued by less than 5 percent against the dollar. The IMF used a new methodology that’s only been in place since 2015 to reach that conclusion, Njoroge said. The formula has been used on advanced economies and only now being applied to emerging markets despite its “well-known” weaknesses, he said. “We are being used as a guinea pig on the External Balance Assessment-Light methodology,” Njoroge said. “The methodology was used in a black box method, which we cannot accept.” The Securities Exchange saw Turnover. of 400.57m shillings.
