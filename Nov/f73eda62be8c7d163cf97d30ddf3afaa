A key witness in the alleged killing of Changamwe tout Caleb Espino, 40, by police has gone into hiding after receiving threats. The witness left his home in Mombasa about three weeks ago. His whereabouts are unknown. Espino’s mother is fearful, too. Her identity and place of stay cannot be revealed for security reasons. The mother said “it was a nightmare” when she learnt about Espino’s demise. “I’m sick and as a widow, I feel bad about my son’s death in police custody,” she said. Muslims for Human Rights has recorded statements from the family with the intention of taking legal action against the police. Espino had been arrested by officers from Changamwe police station on September 18 in Mikindani. Witnesses said he was knocked unconscious by police in the Changamwe cells.
