Joseph ‘Jowie’ Irungu has accused a High court judge who recently called him ‘woman eater’ of being swayed by social media and wants him to disqualify himself from the trial. Jowie who is facing a murder charge together with TV journalist Jacque Maribe said yesterday that Judge James Wakiaga had shown lack of independence and believes he will not get justice before him. Jowie and Maribe are accused of killing Monica Nyawira Kimani in Nairobi on September 19. Irungu said his recent denial of bail was based on the judge’s biases and was not informed by any constitutional or legal reasons. "I am convinced that the judge’s bail denial was not on merit or facts and evidence placed before him but on account of external influence and consideration of false and misleading information on social media platforms against the backdrop of legal and constitutional consideration of judicial independence which is the guarantee of fair trial," said Irungu. Judge Wakiaga had on October 30 during bail ruling referred to Irungu as ‘woman eater’ and denied him bail while releasing Maribe on Sh1 million cash bail.

He said the judge's remarks painted him as a criminal. Also read: Jowie wants Justice Wakiaga replaced for branding him 'woman eater' Click here for the latest political news
