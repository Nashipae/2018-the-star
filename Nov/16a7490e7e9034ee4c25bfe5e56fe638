Nairobi is set to host about 5,000 visitors and delegates from at least 50 countries for the second Music in Africa Conference for Collaboration, Exchange and Showcases (ACCES). The conference runs from today to Saturday at the Kenya National Theatre. ACCES was launched in Dakar, Senegal, last year. Commenting on the coming of the conference to Nairobi, Kenya Tourism Board CEO Betty Radier said: â€œKTB is delighted by the choice of Nairobi as the host city for the ACCES Conference. This is a confirmation of the wide appeal Nairobi has as a Meetings, Incentives, Conference and Exhibition (MICE) destination." Early this year, Nairobi was listed among the top 10 destinations on the rise in the world by the global travel website, TripAdvisor. It was voted third best destination for serving as a fascinating introduction to both wildlife and nightlife.
