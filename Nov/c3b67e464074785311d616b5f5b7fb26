Your child aged three years and above will be asked if they own a mobile phone on the census night by enumerators next year. One of the questions toddlers and other older family members will have to answer is if they know how to use the internet. The government will also be seeking to know from children if they know how to operate a computer, a laptop or a tablet. For 15-year-olds and above, the state wants to know if they are familiar with e-commerce. These are part of the statistic the government will be seeking during the National Population and Housing Census as published in the legal notice by Treasury CS Henry Rotich. The exercise will start on the midnight of August 24 and end after a week. Other questions will touch on ethnicity, orphanhood status, albinism, school attendance status and education attainment. The ethnic statistic is likely to provide fodder for politicians for the 2022 General Election. The census results will also be used by the IEBC in the new border delimitation. Click here for
