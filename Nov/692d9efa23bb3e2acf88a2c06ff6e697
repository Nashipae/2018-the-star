Citizen TV journalist Jacque Maribe has made her first public appearance since her release from prison at Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda's wedding. Maribe landed in Samburu in a chopper with Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and other invited guests on Saturday. Lesuuda and her longtime love Robert Kiplagat exchanged vows at a lavish wedding at ACK St. Phillips Lesirai in Samburu. Maribe is all smiles in a photo taken outside the chopper. She faces murder charges with her co-accused, Joseph "Jowie" Irungu for the killing of businesswoman Monica Kimani in September. She, however, won reprieve after the court released her on a Sh1 million cash bail on October 30. Justice James Wakiaga said the prosecution had not given compelling reasons as to why she should be denied bail. Since her release, Maribe has maintained a low profile life after the court barred her from media interviews on the case. Jowie was denied bail and will remain in custody for the rest of the murder trial. Several dignitaries took to Twitter to congratulate Lesuuda among them Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi. "Hearty congratulations to Samburu West MP, Hon. Naisula Lesuuda, on the auspicious occasion of her wedding today to Mr. Robert Kiplagat. I wish you happiness and God's blessings," Muturi tweeted.
