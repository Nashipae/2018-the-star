National U-23 football team Emerging Stars will be buoyed by the presence of four internationals when they tackle Mauritius in the first leg of the Africa U-23 Cup of Nations qualifying match against Mauritius at Moi Stadium, Kasarani today. The team welcome Ovella Ochieng — who also turns up for the senior team Harambee Stars — Alwyn Tera (Saburtalo, Georgia) Henry Ochieng (Braintree Town, England) and Jonah Ayunga Sutton (England). The match doubles up as a qualifier for the 2020 Olympics. Head coach Francis Kimanzi is expected to face a selection puzzle following the arrival of the four alongside the homebased players who have been outstanding with their respective clubs. Kimanzi is likely to start Ulinzi custodian Timothy Odhiambo between the sticks as immediate former U-20 skipper, Yusuf Mainge and Mathare United’s David Owino take the right and left back positions respectively. Kimanzi, however, faces a task of choosing a solid pair at central defence with KCB’s Michael Kibwage, Mathare United’s Johnstone Omurwa and United States-based Joseph Okumu all available. The battle for starting places in midfield is equally hot with Teddy Osok (Sofapaka), Ibrahim Shambi (Ulinzi), Tera, Ochieng, Sony’s Tobias Otieno, reigning midfielder of the year Cliff Nyakeya (Mathare Ubited) and AFC Leopard’s Marvin Nabwire. Sofapaka forward Piston Mutamba and Ovella are expected to lead the hunt for goals with Boniface Mukhekhe, Jaffari Owiti and Sydney Simale providing options.
