There is a maxim in law
that one cannot be a judge in their own case (Nemo iudex in causa sua). But Kenyan MPs have perfected the art of abusing their power to prosecute
their own selfish interests. Earlier in the year the
MPs fought back and reversed their perks, which had been revised by the Salaries
and Remuneration Commission. Vindictive to a fault, some even tried to exact revenge
against chairperson Sarah Serem when she appeared before them for vetting to
take up a diplomatic appointment. They are back again seeking
to enhance their perks further and live large on the backs of suffering
taxpayers. Yet they are not monks or nuns living in monasteries who need
sustenance. Most are businesspeople, wheeler-dealers and professionals with alternative
sources of income apart from their legislative duties. This unrealistic craving
for paradise in the midst of the poverty and want of those they represent is
sickening. Â Our Parliament poses the
biggest threat to our democracy, rule of law and sanctity of the Constitution. This penchant for self
aggrandisement and grandstanding is precisely what the 2010 Constitution sought
to rein in by creating independent offices and commissions whose work is now being
disregarded. Parliament must respect public participation in its affairs and
submit to the institutions charged with controversial matters such as setting their
pay. This exploitation of citizens is
immoral and unconstitutional.
