I have heard from you that ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi is trying to penetrate Central Kenya. I haven't heard of him reaching out to any leader from Central or holding barazas. If he wishes to do so, he is welcome. But as far as I am concerned, he has a very long way to go. He hasn't made any inroads in my constituency. It's good to be tolerant and we are living in a country that abides by democracy. Any candidate has the freedom to ask for votes anywhere. Mudavadi is welcome in Central Kenya to seek votes. But I promise that he is going to have very hard time, especially due to his past position in working with Central Kenya. He did not support Central Kenya’s presidential candidate. Mudavadi doesn’t seem to be featuring anywhere as far as Building Bridges is concerned. This initiative is selling very well countrywide. We have had antagonistic politics for so long but we now have an opportunity to work together, unite and build our country as a team. But Mudavadi seems to be taking a different direction and won't be welcomed warmly in Central Kenya. Recently, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka boarded the Building Bridges bus, and other opposition leaders are following suit. However, we have not seen Mudavadi joining the team in uniting this nation and, hence, he could be left out somewhere in exclusion, together with his counterpart and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula. This might haunt their future politics because they are going against the grain. I don’t want to call Mudavadi’s penetration of Mt Kenya a non-starter, nor do I want to call it lukewarm, but he has a very long way to go, not only in Central but also countrywide. His kind of politics is not good at this time and in the future he could regret the direction he is taking. With all due respect, I urge Mudavadi to start Building Bridges and he will be more comfortable in his political career.
