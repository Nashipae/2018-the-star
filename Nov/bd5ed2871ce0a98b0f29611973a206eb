Jericho All Stars thumped Technical University of Kenya(TUK) 3-0 to win the Super 8 Champions League at Camp Toyoyo yesterday. The final was graced by retired Brazilian star Ronaldinho, who is in the country courtesy of betting firm Betika — the official sponsors of the grassroot tournament. Jericho who recently won the Super 8 League dominated the match, bouyed by the massive support from the crowds who had turned up to watch the finals and have a glimpse of the 2002 World Cup winner. Bundu Engo was a thorn in the flesh of the students as he was denied twice by the woodwork in the 11th and 24th minutes after being put through by Victor Wallerah and league’s top scorer, Kelvin Nd’ungu, respectively. The wasteful Jericho would have broken the deadlock in the 34th minute through Wallerah who had only the custodian Richard Muruga to beat but had his shot saved. Despite playing under pressure, TUK also had a share of first half attempt. Steve Odhiambo would have side his side ahead in the 38th minute from Philip Wathethe’s pass but his hard-drilled shot swayed inches over the bar. Four minutes after the break, John Analla gave Jericho the opener after Wallerah skipped past two opposing players before the ball landed on Analla who scythed the ball to the roof to give Jericho fans something to smile about. The goal appeared to have polarised TUK’s defence as five minutes later, Ndung’u doubled the scores in an empty net after the defenders failed to clear Engo’s cross. As TUK sought to reduce the deficit, their custodian Muruga allowed an easy third goal in the 82nd minute after a shot by Ndung’u slipped through his fingers due to the light afternoon showers. Jericho pocketed Sh150,000 while TUK took home Sh100,000.
