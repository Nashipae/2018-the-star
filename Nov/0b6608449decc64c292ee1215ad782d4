A 13-year-old-boy accused of sodomising four underage boys has been declared mentally ill and unfit to stand trial by a psychiatrist at Embu Level 5 Hospital. The boy sodomized boys aged between five and seven years in Embu county. A medical report produced in court on Thursday and signed by Dr Thuo J N said the boy would not be able to follow. Embu chief magistrate Maxwell Gicheru had ordered that the boy be escorted to Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital’s psychiatric unit for assessment after he was arraigned in court. The boy is accused of committing the offence on September 27. He also faces alternative charges of committing indecent acts with each of the boys by touching them with his genitals. The accused’s lawyer, Kirimi Guntai, sought the dismissal of the cases against his client following the report. The prosecution opposed the application and urged the court to carry on with the trail since the psychiatrist had not stated the reason why the boy could not stand trial. The chief magistrate ordered the matter continue to it conclusion under Section 176 and the court can determine whether the boy was able to follow the proceedings at the end of the trail. The court ordered the boy be released on Sh100,000 bond and his mother was told to deposit a photocopy of her ID and two passport size photos. The hearing will be on January 23 next year.
