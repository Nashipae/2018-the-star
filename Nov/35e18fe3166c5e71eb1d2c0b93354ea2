There were scuffles in the Homa Bay county assembly yesterday as MCAs fought to block speaker Elizabeth Ayoo from entering her office. Ayoo was impeached last week but got a court order allowing her to return to office. This fighting between rival factions of MCAs in Homa Bay was totally out of order. Ayoo was returning legally and should not have been blocked. Sadly this undemocratic behaviour is becoming increasingly common among MCAs across Kenya. This year alone brawls erupted between MCAs in Kisumu, Kericho, Nairobi, Nakuru, Taita Taveta and Wajir. MCAs must respect protocol in the assemblies. Rowdy MCAs who donâ€™t respect the law need to be brought under control or county assemblies will be permanently destabilised. The Senate should draw up clear regulations to stipulate in detail how MCAs should work with speakers and governors. And the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission should crack down on MCAs who fight with their fists rather than their arguments. They should be investigated and, if necessary, banned from standing in future elections.
