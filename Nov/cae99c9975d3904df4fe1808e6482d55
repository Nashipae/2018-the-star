Kenya’s position in the latest Fifa rankings remains unchanged despite Harambee Stars’ impressive performances witnessed in 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers campaign. Migne’s side maintain the 105th position globally and 23rd on the continental level, a position they have occupied since October. At the time, a 0-0 draw and 3-0 win against Ethiopia guided them to improve from position 107 to 105. Harambee Stars had the biggest leap during the September ranking in terms of points when they stunned Ghana 1-0 in Nairobi in their second qualifying match to improve from 112 to 107 after clinching 22 points (17.9 from beating Ghana and 4.1 from defeating Malawi in an international friendly match also in Nairobi) Lack of playing time this month saw Kenya fail to gain any significant points that would earn them a rise in the rankings. The qualifying match against Sierra Leone was called off after world football governing body, Fifa, failed to come up with the way forward pertaining Sierra Leone’s suspension, forcing the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) to cancel the match. Uganda still top the chart in the Eastern Africa region at position 75 globally, thanks to a 1-0 home win against Cape Verde, which confirmed their qualification to next year’s tourney. The Ugandans have improved four places in the global rankings. Sudan, who are already eliminated from the qualifiers, were big climbers as they jumped eight places to 127. Tanzania, who are in the same group with Uganda and currently placed second in their group, have dropped two places to 138th after a shocking 1-0 loss to 146th ranked Lesotho. Rwanda benefited from Tanzania’s slip up as they now occupy position 137. Burundi’s comfortable 5-2 win against South Sudan in Group ‘C’ meant they jump three places from 142 to 139. Ethiopia and South Sudan occupy position 151 and 164 respectfully. Senegal jumped two places to lead the table in Africa at position 23 in the world followed by Tunisia at position 26 globally. Morocco (40), Nigeria (44) and Democratic Republic of Congo (49) complete the top five places in Africa. Belgium remain top of the world, although the gap between the Red Devils and second-placed France has been reduced to one point while Brazil narrow down the top 3.
