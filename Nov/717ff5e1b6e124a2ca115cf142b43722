The anti-graft agency is pursuing two police officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) who escaped moments after they had been arrested while soliciting a Sh 1 million bribe from a foreigner. The two DCI officers Julius Oguma and Police Constable Charles Macharia are attached at the Kabete Police Station. In a statement sent by EACC on Wednesday, the commission said its detectives laid a trap for the two suspects but they escaped after their colleagues fired in the air to scare the officers from the commission. "The two suspects were arrested and handcuffed but were rescued by their colleagues from Kabete Police Station who fired several rounds of ammunition as warning shots to facilitate the escape of their colleagues," EACC said. The two are said to have escaped with Sh100,000 trap money. "Kabete DCIO is facilitating EACC Kenya officers to find the suspects," the commission said. Earlier today, 15 other officers were arrested in Kwale after being found with Sh11,000 bribes solicited from motorists. The officers reportedly collected the bribes while manning a roadblock on the Likoni - Lunga Lunga highway. Kwale police boss David Kosgei said the police officers raised suspicion after claimed that there was no traffic incident on the said night. He said the OCPD suspected an anomaly and instructed the cops to surrender whatever they had. "We normally brief officers before we send them on duty and even after returning, we take them through a debrief on whatever case they reported."
