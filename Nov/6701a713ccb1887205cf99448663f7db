ODM leader Raila Odinga's daughter Rosemary has said she is adjusting to her new life after losing her sight. Making her first appearance on Tuesday at the Raila Odinga Educational Centre, Rosemary said she will continue with her initiatives which include implementing projects in Kibera. She donated 60 sewing machines to the institution, which will start enrolling women for the programme. "Since my operation and losing my sight, I'm happy people are welcoming and I am now getting confident in how I interact with people and communicate," Rosemary said. Rosemary suffered a minor stroke, leading to her hospitalisation in South Africa in February 2017. The stroke affected her eyesight and forced her to withdraw from the Kibra parliamentary race last year. Rosemary said an operation led to her losing her sight. Women will be trained at the education centre and will get certificates upon completion, from which they can start their own businesses. Rosemary was accompanied by Chang Lee of I Love Africa organisation. Read:Rosemary Odinga speaks out after long absence Click here for the latest political news
