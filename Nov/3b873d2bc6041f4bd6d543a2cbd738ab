Kisumu county government spent Sh157 million in the 2016-2017 financial year to pay ghost workers, the latest report by the Auditor General says. This translates to Sh13 million every month that the county lost to individuals not captured in the official payroll generated from the county. Auditor General Edward Ouko’s report reveals that the lakeside county’s own payroll puts compensation of employees at Sh3,133,266,670 contradicting the financial statements figure of Sh 3,290,083,000. The county could not avail any supporting document for the over Sh150 million difference in staff pay. “The wage bill constitutes 42 per cent of the total receipts during the year. This is contrary to Public Finance Management Regulation 2015, section 107 ( 2 ) that recommends a maximum of 35 per cent,” Ouko said in his report.

According to Ouko, the variances were not explained despite the county recruiting 167 new permanent employees into the workforce during the year under review. The hiring of staff was also found to be heavily tribal pointing to ethnic bias. “The payroll statistics revealed that 97 per cent of the employees were from the dominant ethnic community of Kisumu county. This is contrary to the National Cohesion and Integration Commission Act, 2008,” the reports states.
