Nyamira governor John Nyagarama has appointed trade executive Peter Muga to succeed finance’s Jackline Momanyi who resigned on Friday. Nyagarama announced the change just hours after Momanyi made her resignation public. Momanyi cited frustration as cause of her resignation. “It’s been tough and a change of environment was inevitable. I need to grow and I wish the county all the best,” Momanyi said in her letter to Nyagarama. She served as chief officer for finance until her promotion last year. In August, claims over Momanyi’s pending resignation went viral until she publicly denied she was about to quit. Sources said Nyagarama persuaded her to rescind the resignation. She exits amidst difficulties in implementing basic projects due to insufficient revenues. The county is among those yet to meet their revenue targets. Muga is expected to act as trade executive until a substantive boss is appointed in January. Nyagarama instructed Muga to immediately take over. "In my capacity as the governor of Nyamira, I wish to appoint you as the county executive committee member for finance and planning,” Nyagarama’s letter to Muga reads. "You are directed to take over immediately from Ms Jackline Momanyi, the outgoing executive.” Momanyi becomes the first executive to resign in Nyamira. In 2016, Nyagarama reshuffled his cabinet but the move was opposed by Deputy Governor Amos Nyaribo. Nyaribo said he was not happy with retention of some executives who were accused of misusing funds. Muga becomes the fifth executive for finance after Momanyi, Kepha Osoro, Jones Omwenga and  Reuben Sinange. Click here for the latest political news
