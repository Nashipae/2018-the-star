Busia county assembly has tabled a supplementary budget and revised estimates to Sh8.68billion for the 2018-19 financial year. The revised budget tabled by leader of majority Laban Mukhwana on Tuesday translates to an increase of Sh1.68 billion ( 24 per cent) from the previous approved budget whose total revenue estimates were Sh7.03 billion. Busia acting Finance executive Phaustine Barasa in a foreword said the increase was as a result of balances brought forward in the County Revenue Fund of Sh718.22 million. It was also attributed to disbursement of Sh553 million under Kenya Devolution Support Program for development, Sh275.3 million under Road Maintenance Fuel Levy Fund, Sh8.6 million under DANIDA, Sh24.2 million under KDSP capacity building, Sh63.7 million under development of youth polytechnics and Sh14.39 million as contractorsâ€™ retention. The Finance CEC said despite the increase in the budget estimates, the county government had accumulated total commitments amounting to Sh1.9 billion, adding that austerity measures have been proposed to bridge the gap as well as address local revenue collection deficit.
