Rap royalty King Kaka will be releasing his fifth album, 'Eastlando Royalty', on November 30 at Uhuru Gardens. Kaka says coming from Eastlands inspired the name. "Eastlands is my hood, it has been royal to me," Kaka told Word Is. "The term 'Eastlando Royalty', if you look at it, it does not seem to co-exist. But I want people to know that you can come from a place that seems to not to favour you and turn out great." The album has 18 songs on the physical copy and 22 on digital. His message to his fans before the launch is: "Expect a different not ordinarily concert, and I am hoping they will have a good experience and not just attend a concert. Experience is what I want for my fans. "The album basically has a great meaning to me and my fans because I am a living testimony that everyone can be what they have always wanted to to be." Kaka has been doing a series of events leading up to the most anticipated album launch in Kenya. The surprise album listening parties all over Kenya began on October 30 in Kitale and came to a conclusion early this week in Machakos, with raving reviews from King Kakaâ€™s fans. During the first week of October, King Kaka went around universities, speaking to students about his journey as an artiste, entrepreneur and activist. He visited six campuses: Zetech University, KCA University, Mount Kenya University, Kabarak University, Moi University and Maseno University, reaching 6,015 students.  The launch will be sponsored by different brands, including Songa Music App by Safaricom, Coca-Cola, among others.
