Three Chinese nationals yesterday pleaded not guilty to three counts of bribery and were remanded until Friday. The three, Li Gen, Li Xiaowu and Sun Xin, are employees of China Roads and Bridges Corporation, the firm that built the standard gauge railway. They were accused of attempting to bribe a team of investigators led by Andrew Warui to influence an ongoing investigation against them. The ongoing investigation also touches on Florence Gitau, an SGR ticket booking clerk, who was charged with stealing and forgery, and Esther Chemaswa Mushong, also a ticket booking clerk who was also charged with stealing. They attempted to give the investigators Sh500,000 at the SGR Mombasa Terminus last Thursday. The first instalment was supposed to be Sh200,000 which was given on Friday. Their lawyers, Nelson Sitonik and Queenton Ochieng, asked the court to release the three on bond. Chief Magistrate Julius Nangâ€™eya said he will issue a ruling on Friday.
