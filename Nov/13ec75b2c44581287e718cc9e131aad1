Diabetic patients below the age of 21 will be supplied with free insulin by the county government starting this month, governor Wilber Ottichilo has said. Speaking at Emusire primary school in Emuhaya during World Diabetes Day on Wednesday, Ottichilo said that access to insulin from all health facilities across the county will be free of charge. He said diabetes testing will be free and his administration will allocate more funds towards health. The governor said this will ensure youth who are unemployed are able to access testing and treatment for the disease. Director of Medical Services Peter Cherutich urged governors to prioritise health and buy drugs for people living with diabetes especially children. Vihiga county Health chief officer Dr Arnold Mamadi said residents should embrace healthy living to avoid lifestyle diseases. He said statistics showed that over 2,000 people are living with diabetes in the county with the figures steadily rising over the past few years.
