At least 800 sheep and goats in Taita Taveta have died from hypothermia condition, a report from Department of Livestock Veterinary Laboratory in Mariakani has established. The livestock died two weeks ago at Taita Taveta ranches. Hypothermia is a condition where the body temperature of an animal falls below a critical level and it’s not able to perform metabolic functions that keep it alive. Officers from the County veterinary department were last week dispatched to the affected ranches where they took samples of the animals and forwarded them to Mariakani laboratory for proper analysis. Davis Mwangoma, the County Livestock and Agriculture CEC said the laboratory results show that the animals were exposed to prolonged exposure to low temperature during the 30 hours rain. “Having considered the preliminary laboratory report from Mariakani, the deaths that were observed in animals in various areas, especially ranches in the county, are mostly attributed to hypothermia. Flocks, especially of sheep that were kept in open bomas, were most affected with very high mortalities,” added Mwangoma. The deaths sparked reactions among residents for fear of disease outbreak. They feared that their livestock might have been infected by hundreds of livestock flocking in the county from northern Kenya. They accused livestock and veterinary officers of not reacting on time to prevent the deaths. “We also urge our farmers to ensure cleanliness of the animal sheds to reduce opportunist infections,” said Mwangoma.
