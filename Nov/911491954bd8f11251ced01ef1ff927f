An Investor plans to build a dam to help boost water supply in Murang’a and neighbouring areas. Aqua Trench Designs and Works company has written to the Murang’a government seeking approval to carry out a feasibility study and eventually build the dam, which will also be used to produce hydropower. In a letter to county secretary Patrick Mukuria, CEO James Macharia said the feasibility study will include an assessment of the county’s domestic and irrigation water needs. “This project is envisaged to benefit millions and have a huge economic and social impact,” he said.
