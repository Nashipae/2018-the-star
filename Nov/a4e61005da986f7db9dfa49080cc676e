DP William Ruto on Friday hosted President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga at his Karen residence, Nairobi. Uhuru and Ruto met alone for about an hour before Raila joined them 34 minutes later. The three held discussions for 30 minutes as they had lunch.They all arrived in official convoy but their aides and security officials were kept away from the meeting. Only Elgeyo Marakwet senator Kipchumba Murkomen was in the meeting. It was the first time that Ruto formally hosted Uhuru and Raila since the March 9 handshake, which reset the political relationship between the two. Uhuru and Ruto had come from the memorial service of former Maendeleo ya Wanawake chairperson Jane Kiano at St Francis ACK Church in Karen. During the service, Raila distanced himself and Uhuru from the dynasty tag. “Jomo Kenyatta was a son of a pauper. He struggled [and] was detained by the colonialists for all those years. Because of that, you cannot say Uhuru is part of a dynasty,” Raila said. “Odinga, son of Raila, was just a pauper. You would say he was just a hustler. You cannot, therefore, say that Raila is a product of a dynasty.” Click here for the latest political news
