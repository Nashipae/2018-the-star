Ambulance staff in the Somali capital Mogadishu say at least eight people have been killed and 15 injured in a car bomb explosion. The vehicle was detonated beside a row of shops in the Wadajir District of the city. Somalia's National Intelligence and Security Agency says the bomber has been arrested. While no group has yet said it was behind the attack, the Islamist militant group al-Shabab frequently bomb government and civilian targets in the city. This attack is in addition to an earlier attack we reported on a religious centre, killing a cleric and at least 14 of his followers. A police spokesman said al-Shabab gunmen and a suicide bomber targeted the Sufi Muslim shrine in the city of Galkayo. Click here for the latest political news
