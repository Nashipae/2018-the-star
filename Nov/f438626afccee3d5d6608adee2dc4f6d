Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo wants the government to find permanent solutions to perennial conflicts at the Kisumu-Nandi border. He said yesterday that many lives have been lost and property destroyed in the recent past. On Saturday, George Benjo was attacked and killed in Nyangore. Banjo was retired judge Effie Owuor’s farm manager. Koyoo appealed to the government to establish the real causes of the clashes. He urged the police to arrest the killers and ensure they are prosecuted. Kisumu county commissioner Pauline Dola said they are working with officers from Nandi county to arrest the suspect. “We appeal to anyone with information about the whereabouts of the wanted murderers to promptly inform the nearest police officer or report to the nearest station,” she said.
