Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata will be the guest of honor at the Gatanga Night on Friday, featuring benga music from Central Kenya in Carnivore Restaurant. "I will be gracing the occasion to support Muranga talent, which has dominated Kikuyu secular music for so long," Kang'ata told Word Is. Veteran musicians like Daniel 'DK' Kamau, Peter Kigia, Timona Mburu, John Dematthew and Kariuki Kiarutara all come from Gatanga constituency in Murangâ€™a county. They are on a mission to groom a new generation of singers, and have been holding talent shows across the constituency the past few months. "We are raising funds to build a studio for upcoming artistes as we launch our new stars from Gatanga," area MP Joseph Nduati Ngugi said. The last Gatanga Night was held in 2012 under the patronage of then Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth.
