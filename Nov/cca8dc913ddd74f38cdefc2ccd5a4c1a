Nandi residents have opposed a plan by a gold mining firm to expand its tailing dam. Karebe Mining Company in Chemase, Tinderet subcounty, wants to expand the dam where it disposes of its effluent to allow for expanded exploration. It has acquired about eight acres for the project. But residents, led by MCA Hillary Serem, have opposed it. They have petitioned the county government to stop it. In September, Mining PS George Omenge visited the site and urged the firm to involve residents in development and environmental issues. MD David May had complained of frustrations and interference from local leaders. He said they pay billions in royalties to the government annually. Yesterday, Serem said the environment impact assessment was carried out without public participation. He wants the DCI to investigate minutes allegedly forged and used in the endorsement of the project. An EIA report had signatures of senior government officials, including county commissioners. “This is fraud that requires thorough investigations into the circumstances that led to the endorsement of a tailing dam with far-reaching implications on residents’ health,” he said in Kapsabet. The minutes that accompany the EIA document, purporting to indicate public participation was done are fake, he said.
