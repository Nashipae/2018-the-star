Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangâ€™i has reiterated that there is no turning back on plans to restore order in the public transport sector. He spoke in Nakuru on Saturday during a fundraiser for California SDA Church in Kaptembwa. Matiang'i said tightening rules will not drive away investors in the PSV sector, but will help them maximise profits and save lives. "Most people who perish in road accidents are young. When we lose young people the economy slows down. Matatu madness must stop," he said. The CS said insurance companies that give fake licences are under scrutiny.
