A family in Kandara subcounty is grieving following the mysterious death of their son who sat the KCPE exam this year. Juliano Kanyonyo, who was a pupil at Gatitu Primary School, was found dead in his room on Sunday by his mother. The 15-year-old boy was the third-best student in his school, scoring 376 marks. Henry Mwaura was the top student in the school with 382 marks, followed by Grace Nyambura, who scored 377. Kanyonyo's uncle Joseph Kamande said his nephew was circumcised on Monday last week and was having bed rest when he passed away. Kamande said there was blood oozing out of Kanyonyo's mouth. “I cannot explain the shock we have gone through because he was a perfectly healthy boy and his circumcision wounds were almost healed,” he said. It was even more heartbreaking to receive his good results, he said, knowing he would not be able to celebrate them. An autopsy will be done at the Thika Level 5 Hospital. Gatitu Primary School headteacher Robert Muchara said Kanyonyo's death is shocking. He described him as a bright and disciplined pupil. Elsewhere, Brian Nderitu from Elite Academy was the best candidate in Murang’a county, while Technology Primary School is the best-performing school. The school had more than 20 students with over 400 marks. The top three pupils were Micky Muchoki (437), Ken Maina (431) and Nelson Kamunyo (430). At Bishop Kairo Academy, Laulynn Wambui was the top student with 431 marks. Gloria Wanyaga from Green Cottage Academy had 429 marks, while Joan Waiyego from Bishop Perlo Girls Boarding School had 420 marks.
