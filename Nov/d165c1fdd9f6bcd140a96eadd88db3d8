The police are holding 11 people suspected of abetting cheating in the ongoing KCSE exam at Shikokho Secondary School, Ikolomani subcounty. They include supervisors and teachers. On Tuesday morning, one teacher was arrested and another escaped from a house nearby the school. The arrest followed a report by Kakamega South subcounty director of education Kipsang Birech. The second teacher and nine others were arrested later the same day and locked up at Malinya police station. Kakamega South subcounty police boss Bernard Shari yesterday said the two teachers were hiding in a house near the school and were suspected to be generating answer sheets for the candidates. Photocopies of Agriculture scripts and Geography paper 2 and answers were recovered from the house during the raid. The officers also recovered mobile phones and textbooks. Shari said investigations were underway and some of the suspects would be turned into witnesses before others are charged in court. Last year, the Kenya National Examinations Council cancelled the results of 191 candidates at the school over cheating. This year, Knec officials Rosemary Saina and Paul Korir and Education ministry officers Christine Muchemi and Martin Kungania have been put in charge of supervising the exam to avoid a repeat of what happened last year. On Monday, Education CS Amina Mohamed said anti-cheating measures put in place by the government were paying off. She spoke before releasing KCPE exam results in Mombasa. The KCSE exam will end on Wednesday next week.
