Mathare United’s Cliff Nyakeya is not under pressure to perform ahead of the next month SportPesa Premier League despite winning won the Midfielder of the Year accolades. Nyakeya said if there will be any pressure then it will be for him to improve his own performance. “I have no pressure at all. I mean I am the same player who played last season to bag the Midfielder of the Year title and I will be lying if I say I am under pressure. My career has been progressing since I left Gor Mahia Youth in 2016 and I am keen to keep improving my performance,” said the 23-year-old. “If anything, I want to go an extra mile next season to ensure I win more gongs that will be on offer,” he said. The player, who scored 14 goals in the just concluded 2018 season, helped his side to place eighth in the SportPesa Premier League. Nyakeya is, however, not happy that despite numerous call-ups to the national team, Harambee Stars, he hasn’t been granted playing time. “I am not happy because I haven’t featured for the national team despite numerous call ups. However, I intend to put in extra effort and hopefully, I would receive green light in future assignments,” said Nyakeya a Liverpool fan. Asked about the team’s preparedness ahead of the season, the midfielder said they are at good place. Mathare start title campaign against Chemelil Sugar at the Moi International Sports Centre (MISC), Kasarani on December 8. He said: “We have played to a barren draw twice and results gone either way in our past meeting and therefore it will be an interesting tie but we are a good team and with our preparations we have had, we are hopefully of three points.” “I cannot talk about my future now. What I know is that I have a one year remaining on my contract with Mathare and I am focused and committed to it. As to what will happen thereafter, only time will tell.”
