Nairobi County Government has launched a crackdown on rate defaulters who owe Sh15 billion. In the first phase launched on Thursday, eight properties with arrears amounting to Sh7.8 were clamped down by the county. Governor Mike Sonko has already warned that there will be no waivers for the rates and license defaulters. “We will stick to our notice. The county does not intend to give waivers this year, so the defaulters should pay their rates,” he said. Among the areas covered during the crackdown include, the Central Business District, Kilimani, Thika Road, Ngara and Parklands. The last clampdown by the county netted more than Sh15 billion. The County Government Rating Act gives City Hall authority to place a charge on a property which has not paid rates. Click here for the latest political news
