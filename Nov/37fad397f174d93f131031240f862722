Gospel singer Bahati's wife Diana Marua has been trolled after posting photos of her birthday party, which happened on Monday in Naivasha. Some followers think Bahati is wasting money while his grandfather, whom he visited recently, is languishing in poverty. Diana wrote on social media: "Another year to be Grateful for Today was unexplainable! Thank you babe @bahatikenya for making this day memorable. Happy Born Day to me." Piuson Murithi responded: "Hope you discussed how you will build grandpa house that u will be proud of. grandpa is your blood and fresh others are the outcome of your grandpa so rudisha mkono #houseforgrandpa" Diana celebrated her 30th birthday and another fan, Fei Jeff, wrote: "Bahati, Bahati of all the women you have met, served God together you didn’t find a young gal for u to marry."
