Some Garissa MCAs yesterday said they will stand with speaker Ibrahim Abass if their colleagues seek to remove him. Leader of Majority Mahat Osman said the speaker has been diligent in his work. Assembly operations were halted yesterday after the county staff protested against alleged abuse and high-handedness by the speaker. Abass is also facing accusations of disrespect from MCAs. But Osman said no removal motion will go through as they will defend Abass. Dadaab MCA Mohamed Abdi said the MCAs have a cordial relationship with Abass and the executive. But Garissa ward representative Mohamud Omar and his Fafi counterpart Hassan Halane said the removal process will go on. Halane urged MCAs to ‘look at the bigger picture’ and stop being sycophants of the executive’.
