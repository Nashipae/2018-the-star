Nominated MP David ole Sankok will have to pay his former driver half salary, pending conclusion of a suit filed against him. In the case, Raphael Kapaya says he was fired without justifiable reasons and his rights to a fair hearing and a fair administrative action were violated. He was employed by Sankok on a five-year contract on October 1 last year. Yesterday, Milimani Commercial Court senior principal magistrate Addah Obura directed that Kapaya be paid half salary as the case continues. “I’ve also ordered that this matter be referred for arbitration as per Clause 9 of the contract of employment between the parties,” she said. Sankok said he had replaced Kapaya for assaulting him and breaking his crutches while drunk and disorderly. Kapaya’s lawyer Vincent Lempaa dismissed the allegations. He said the MP did not report or give evidence. The documents say the MP terminated his contract so he can “practice nepotism” in his office as he has employed his wife as a personal assistant, his girlfriend as his personal aide and his brother-in-law as his secretary.
