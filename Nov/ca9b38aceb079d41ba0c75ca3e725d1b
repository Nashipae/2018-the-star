Three University of Nairobi students accused of violently robbing and injuring their comrade and the university's staffer yesterday pleaded with a Milimani court to defer their plea taking until Monday. They are Arnold Ondenyo, Alfred Owuor and Chris Wasonga. The trio are facing three counts of robbery with violence. In the first count, they are accused of violently robbing Michael Kanyi of Sh 11, 000 and printing papers worth Sh 97, 500 inside the UoN bureau on Tuesday afternoon while armed with pangas.

The three were allegedly in a gang of nine that raided the shop inside the bureau where Kanyi was employed by Rayori and Mogaka and stole the items and injured him during the alleged robbery. They later left and met Rayori and Mogaka at a shoe shiner's joint along Koinange street where they also robbed and assaulted them. Mogaka ducked Odenyo's attempt to hack him on the head and escaped with a cut on the leg during the robbery. Police officers shot in the air to scare the suspected gangsters and teamed up with members of public to arrest them. Their six accomplices escaped. Yesterday, Odenyo told senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku that he needed to seek medication before pleading to the charges. Owuor said his lawyer was not present and there are issues that he needed to sort out some issues before taking plea. Mutuku remanded them until Monday when they will be charged.
