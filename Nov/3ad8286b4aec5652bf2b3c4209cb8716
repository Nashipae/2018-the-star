Two university students drowned in River Yala while taking selfies in Bondo, Siaya County on Saturday evening. The two, Derrick Auka a third-year student at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology and Shallete Atieno of Bondo Technical Training Institute, were on a scenic tour of the area before the incident occurred. Area chief Walter Omollo said Atieno, who was taking selfies on a stone next to the river, slid and fell into the water. The chief said the other student dived in the river to rescue her but unfortunately was overwhelmed by the powerful currents and also drowned. By Sunday evening, police and residents in the area were still camped at the river searching for the two students. Confirming the incident the Bondo OCPD Harriet Kinya said they had received reports of the incident, which happened at around 3pm on Saturday. The OCPD assured residents of conclusive investigations would be done to establish what exactly happened at the scene. "My officers are already at the scene to find out all the details before we come up with a comprehensive report on what exactly happened,” said Kinya. The police boss said that Auka was a third-year student at Jaramogi University pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Agriculture while Atieno was pursuing a Diploma in Supply chain management at Bondo Technical Training Institute. Speaking to the Star on phone, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University official Kezia Ogada said they had always advised students to exercise caution while outside the institution.
