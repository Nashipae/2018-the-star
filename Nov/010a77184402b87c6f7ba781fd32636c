Police have detained eight Ambira Boys High School students for a week after they insulted CSs Amina Mohamed and Fred Matiang'i. A video of their 'academic bonfire' went viral last week as they burned their books and insulted the ministers. They boasted in the video that they had 'cheated' but education officials have indicated that they don't think that the exams were compromised. This was probably just youthful foolishness. The 'academic bonfire' is a widespread part of school culture in Kenya. Pupils blow off steam after finishing their exams, often by insulting their teachers and burning books. It is bad behaviour to insult your elders and burn books but does it justify their arrest? Is it criminal to insult a minister? Politicians insult each other all the time. How different are these young boys? They were misguided to post this rowdy video online. Local church leaders, teachers and parents should advise them that such loutish behaviour will lead to failure in later life. These boys should be counselled rather than being prosecuted.
