Police in Nyandarua have exhumed the body of a man that was wrongly buried last week. Relatives of Gicheche Mwihaki presumed he died after he went missing and they buried a body they believed was his, but he reappeared two days after the burial. Family members obtained a court order to exhume the body they buried at Magumu village in Kinangop. Last month, two bodies were found dumped in Ngumbi Forest off the Limuru-Mai Mahiu Road and taken to Naivasha Sub-county Hospital mortuary. Mwihaki's family identified one of the bodies as belonging to their relative. A postmortem was done on November 5 and the body released for burial on Tuesday last week. However, on Thursday evening, Mwihaki presented himself at the police station. Njabini police boss Jane Munywoki said an inquiry file has been opened following the bizarre incident.

A relative who declined to be named said a special cleansing ceremony will be done after the exhumation. He said Mwihaki has been told to stay away from the homestead until the "foreign" body is removed as per the Kikuyu customs. "Mwihaki will only return home after a goat is slaughtered and a special ceremony done around the grave to cleanse this homestead," he said. Last week, a shaken Mwihaki said he worked as a casual labourer at Longonot trading centre and was not aware of news about his "death". He realised something was amiss when one of his friends acted funny and kept away from him. "There was no TV, radio or even mobile phone where I was working. I was shocked when I returned home only to learn that I had been declared dead and buried,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
