NHIF boss Geoffrey Mwangi and finance director Wilbert Kurgat have been remanded at Industrial Area prison until tomorrow when the court will rule on their bail application. The two on Monday denied charges of conspiring to defeat justice and disobeying a court order following the probe into the loss of millions of shillings at the insurer. It is alleged that between September 26 and November 23 at the NHIF officers, they jointly conspired to prevent the execution of a order issued by the court. They were separately charged for failing to produce for scrutiny, a book or books of evidential value in connection with investigations being undertaken. Mwangi and Kurgat, through their lawyers, asked the court to grant them reasonable bail terms arguing that they are law abiding citizens. They also argued that they would comply with all conditions issued by the court. However, the prosecution strongly opposed their release on bail saying that they cannot be trusted since "they have already interfered with the investigations". State Counsel Alexander Muteti told the court that Mwangi wrote messages to Kurgat directing him not to give the documents to the officers. According to Muteti, the two officers have already actively interfered with the investigation by the evidence of the text messages produced in court. They were before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi.
