Kenya Ports Authority will take on hosts Ferroviario de Maputo in the FIBA Africa women’s Club Championships quarter-final encounter today. KPA finished third in Pool ‘B’ after two wins and two losses while their opponents placed a point behind group winners Inter Clube in Pool ‘A’ after three wins and a loss. KPA will once again rely on their Ugandan import, Jamila Nansikombi, who currently leads the scorers chart with 96 points, followed by Italee Lucas of Inter Club of Angola with 54 points. The Kenyans will, however, be wary of the hosts fast and offensive play. The hosts will also be motivated by the large crowd attendance that has been witnessed in all the matches the home side has played. The other Kenyan team Equity Bank did not make it through to quarters after a three-way tie with FAP of Cameroon and V-Club of DR Congo eliminated them on goal aggregate. Congo’s V-Club complicated Equity Bank chances when they whipped FAP 70-42. The three teams won only one game and lost three. In the other quarter-final matches, favourites Inter Clube will meet MB2ALL after the Madagascan side beat win-less Lakers from Zimbabwe 58-48 to make the cut. An all-Congolese quarter-final will pit V-Club against compatriots INSS while FAP will play Pool ‘B’ leaders First Bank of Nigeria.
