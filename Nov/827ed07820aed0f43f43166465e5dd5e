Five people were arrested with 100 kilos of bhang during a police operation at Barsheba in Mombasa on Sunday. The five were nabbed at a house in Toa Tugawe, a notorious area known for insecurity incidents in Kisauni constituency. It was in the area that the dreaded juvenile Wakali Kwanza gang used to pounce on women, sucking their breasts. Kisauni police boss Sangura Musee told journalists that the arrest followed a tip off by members of the public. "The locals alerted police officers on patrol of a suspicious consignment being offloaded into a house." "The officers acted fast, went into the place and found about five young men handling the consignment," Musee said. The bhang was well-packaged complete with a seal in each of the 10 bales. The bales were labelled Alex, who police suspect was to be the recipient of the consignment. "The bhang seems to be from outside Mombasa. It could be coming from a neighbouring country," said Musee. Detectives told the Star the kind of packaging indicated the bhang is meant for well-to-do people. "They had flavoured rolling papers, which is more expensive than the usual rolling paper," a detective told the Star. One of the package had a label written "If seal is broken, please check the content inside to make sure it is intact". This is unusual, the police boss said adding that a hunt for the said Alex is on. "It could be a fictitious name but we are investigating," Musee said.  The five suspects nabbed with 100kg of bhang in Mombasa on Sunday, November 25, 2018. /BRIAN OTIENO Police also recovered Sh20,000 in different denominations upon a search at the house. The five also had a weighing scale. Apart from the bales, some of the bhang had also been packed in small plastic sachets. “This appears to be a consignment not for the lowly addicts. This is meant for high value clients,” said one detective. Click here for the latest political stories
