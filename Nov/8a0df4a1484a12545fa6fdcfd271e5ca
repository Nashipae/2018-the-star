The National Land Commission has been sued in a dispute over a plot valued at Sh600 million which is claimed by two families. Loise Wairimu, Ruth Wanjiru and Winnie Wangu want NLC’s decision to revoke the title deed be suspended until the case is determined. The three are the administrators of the estate of Maaka Mukuhi Mugweru, their father. NLC revoked the title after a complaint by Losie Wanjiru and Godwin Wachira who are the administrators of estate of Gichuhi Kimira. Both Mugweru and Gichuhi have died. Mugweru’s family said hey were never informed of the review process. The family said NLC did not have powers to look into complaints and made the decision the way it did. They said the complaint filed by Gichuhi’s family was illegal because the dispute had been dealt with at the High Court and Court of Appeal. The dispute was first filed in the High Court in 1977 and was determined in 1989.
