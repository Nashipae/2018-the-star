Residents of Githunguri in Mavoko have threatened to transfer their votes to neighbouring Nairobi ahead of 2022 elections, citing neglect by Machakos leaders. They said on Saturday that they have been sidelined. Residents said it was pointless to vote in Machakos when they are forced to seek services from Nairobi. “Some of us have already transferred our votes to Nairobi. We’ll encourage more people to switch if the problem persists,” Moses Kairu said. Githunguri is part of the Muthwani ward in Machakos. Residents said they rely on services from the Nairobi county government despite paying taxes to Machakos. “We are in Mavoko in Machakos county yet we seek services from Nairobi because we have been sidelined,” Arnold Githinji said. They deplored the poor state of roads, lack of hospitals, water, schools, market, police post and security lights. “Mwangaza-Kiuka and Mlolongo-Kamulu roads should be tarmacked. There is no security in Githunguri. We rely on Mlolongo police station which is several kilometers away,” Githinji said. They spoke during a meeting with Muthwani MCA George King’ori at Githunguri shopping centre. Githinji said residents have never benefited from public funds including the Youth Enterprise Development Fund, Women’s, Uwezo and National Government Affirmative Action funds.
