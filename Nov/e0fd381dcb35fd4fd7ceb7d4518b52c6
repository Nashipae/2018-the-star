Good Morning The High Court on Friday certified as urgent a case in which two activists are seeking to compel the Competition Authority to break the Kenya Power and Lighting Company’s monopoly and dominance as required by law. Justice Wilfrida Okwany further directed all the respondents to respond to the petition and the case will be mentioned on November 19. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Saturday morning. Kalonzo to be appointed peace envoy President Uhuru Kenyatta is considering appointing Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka special peace envoy. Kalonzo's role, according to State House sources, will be to mediate and restore peace in conflict areas locally and will also be sent out of the country where Kenya's help will be required.

The author of that article compared our Senate with the American one, which does have significant powers. He asks, “What stops MPs from performing the functions of Senate when the constituencies they represent in Parliament are part of the same counties Senate oversees?” His may seem like a shrewd question, but actually contains the seeds of its answer. _____________________________________________________ Fact Check: Mt. Kenya counties do not contribute 60 per cent to Kenya's GDP Central Kenya leaders last month claimed that the region contributes 60 per cent to Kenya’s GDP and proposed that county allocation revenue be based on population and contribution to national cake. They argued that the current formula that factors in landmass and poverty levels has made the national government to neglect the region in the allocation of resources. In Siasa, the Star demonstrates why this is untrue. _____________________________________________________ My battle with depression: Trio’s mental illness diaries Three women open up pages of their diaries as they share how they have battled with depression.
