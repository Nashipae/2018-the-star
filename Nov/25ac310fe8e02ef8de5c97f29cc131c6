Busia residents say Busia Sugar Industries Ltd should be demolished. Joseph Muchesia and Aggrey Sakala, through lawyer Macmillan Mutiso, have petitioned the National Environmental Tribunal in Nairobi, saying the factory built along River Soi, Busibwato location, Matayos subcounty, will pollute the river. Deputy President William Ruto launched the factory on Saturday. The residents say they were ignored and no public participation forum was organised before construction began. The licence is, therefore, illegal, they said. “The commencement of the operation of the factory shall be contrary to the law, as there is no licence issued under Section 58 of the Environment Management and Coordination Act (EMCA) No 8 of 1999 (Environmental Impact Assessment Licence),” they say. Through a March 9 Gazette notice, the Sugar Directorate called for objections from people opposed to the establishment of the factory. Some millers had opposed licensing of another miller in Busia county because of cane competition. Muchesia and Sakala say the water is used by residents and should be protected. They say the project poses “extreme and irreparable risk” to the environment, and the people of Busia “shall be gravely and adversely offended”. They want the tribunal to revoke the licence issued by Nema and order destruction of structures. Nema has been listed as first the respondent, and Africa Polysack Ltd and Busia Sugar Industries Ltd the second and third. The petitioners say Nema allowed construction upstream of Mundika Water Treatment Plant that supplies the region. They say the factory is built within a 40km radius from another cane factory and the two cannot be “environmentally sustained” by local resources. Click here for the latest political news
