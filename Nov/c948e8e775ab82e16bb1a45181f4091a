The government has said it
will pay sugarcane farmers arrears amounting to Sh2.6 billion before Christmas. Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri, however, said the payments will be made after the vetting of all farmers is done. “A committee of officials from the Ministry has been formed to vet farmers afresh.
We want to determine who the genuine farmers are, how much they are owed and
how much some of these farmers owe sugar factories,” Kiunjuri said. The debt, according to the ministry, dates back to
2014. Mumias Sugar Company is owed Sh889 million, Sony Sugar ShSh512 million as from April to October, Muhoroni-Miwani
Sh474 million from March 2017 to May,  Chemelil Sugar Sh201million from January,
while Nzoia is owed Sh524 million. He said the committee will start the vetting on Monday, when he will also meet farmers in the sugar
growing counties of Kisumu, Migori and Bungoma. Read: Farmers reminisce about good old days when sugar paid Kiunjuri spoke yesterday at Kilimo House, when he launched a new sugar task force aimed at identifying challenges facing the industry. The CS said the
task force is expected to give recommendations to fix problems
bedevilling the industry within the next 30 days. It will also offer practical
solutions that will make industry competitive. This is in response to President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive on
October 20 in Kakamega. The 16-member task
force will be co-chaired by the CS and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. The members will include governors Anyang Nyong’o (Kisumu)  and Okoth Obado (Migori), who will represent the Council of Governors. Others are MPs and senators from the sugar growing areas and other industry players. Sugar
production According to statistics from the Sugar Directorate, sugar
domestic production decreased in 2017 by 375, 000 metric tonnes from 639,000
metric tonnes in 2016. This is against the country’s annual consumption of one million
tonnes, with 850,000 tonnes of table sugar and 150,000 tonnes of industrial sugar. Equally, area under cane farming decreased from 220,000 hectares in 2016 to
195, 000 hectares in 2017 due to drought and the underperformance of
Mumias Sugar Company. The directorate estimates an increase in domestic production
this year to 470,000 mts. More: Uhuru orders cane farmers to be paid Sh2.6bn arrears See also: Farmers, staff not paid as sugar firms sag under Sh16.5bn debt Click here for
