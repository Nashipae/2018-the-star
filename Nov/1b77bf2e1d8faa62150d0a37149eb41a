Kenya Defence Forces’ right attacker Phillip Maiyo will skip Kenya Volleyball Federation (KDF) play-offs set for November 30 to December 2 at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. Team’s coach Pius Birech said although the right attacker was fielded in some of the regular season matches, he will not be available for the event due to personal commitment. He admitted that Maiyo’s absence will be a big blow for the team. “Having had professional stints in Bulgaria and Qatar, we will no doubt miss the services of Maiyo. He is an experienced player, whose expertise would have been helpfully as we make a return to the play-off later this month,” said the official. “Just as the team defied odds to eventually make a cut to the last four, we are equally ready to ruffle few feathers in the three-day event that will see two teams earn tickets to the next year’s Africa Club Championship and therefore, we are optimistic of good results.” Experienced former national team setter Elisha Aliwa and KDF women’s team coach said they are training hard as they target to upset champions General Service Unit and Kenya Prisons. “This is our second day in training at the Moi Airbase Indoor facility in Eastleigh. We will train here for quite some time before we move to the event venue. We are giving our all in the training as our target is to at least upset the top two teams,” noted Aliwa. “We have a young squad full of energy and we hope our return to the last four will not be in vain. We will be challenging for the title.” KDF start their title hunt against former champions Kenya Prison on November 30, then crosswords with holders GSU before they line up against regulars Kenya Ports Authority in their last match of the event.
