I was deeply saddened by John Gakuoâ€™s untimely demise. We shall remember him as an astute civil servant who dedicated his life to serving Kenyans. His dutiful service to this city spanned over seven years cannot be gainsaid. He was part of a team that gave its best in the regeneration of Nairobi. Justice is indeed blind. Sometimes the innocent get caught up in its rhetoric in its bid to effect accountability and designate responsibility. With that regard, the allegations brought against John are subject to the truth. Justice is a product of truth, and truth is irrefutably founded on tangible facts. Consequently, we must examine the facts concerning the character of our dearly departed. John was an exceptionally forthright and incorruptible, and displayed admirable qualities of leadership, integrity and diligence. Therefore, I am troubled by the charges he faced as they are contradictive and unreflective of his character. It is regrettable that he spent his final moments ailing and enduring punishment for an alleged crime. Truth begets amity, and as such, it is unfortunate he shall not witness truth brought about by the passage of time. He is a victim of circumstance and I believe deserves justice to his name through posthumous acquittal and recognition for his service to the nation. I am confident his innocence will come to light. It is sad that as a country we adore, admire and even at times celebrate and cherish thieves., who should be cooling behind bars. Sadly, they are walking freely and enjoying the loot from public coffers. These are our role models. A guilty conscious needs no accuser, but innocence is validated by eulogization and cemented by legacy. Fair Thee Well my brother.  Last Town Clerk, Nairobi
