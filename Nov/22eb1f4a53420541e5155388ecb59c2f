Nominated MCAs to the Kisii county assembly have for the second time protested over less privileges offered to them compared to their elected counterparts. They accused the assembly service board of failing to honour a circular from the Salaries and Remuneration Commission requiring it to employ for them a driver, a secretary and a personal assistant. In a joint statement read on their behalf by Caren Magara, the MCAs accused the board of not allocating the office space as the commission had recommended. They said they have been begging speaker David Kombo to follow up the matter but there has been no response from him. “We have been going through a lot of tribulations since we joined the assembly because our interests are not taken care of. We are being treated as lesser beings in the assembly,” they said. In August, the MCAs stormed out of the assembly after speaker Kombo disallowed a debate that pushed for the nominated members to get staff, be paid their salaries and allowances.
