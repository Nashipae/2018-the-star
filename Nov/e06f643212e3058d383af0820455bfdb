The government has taken back land that had been fenced off by a daring private developer at the Eldoret State Lodge two weeks ago. Part of the land (pictured) had been fenced off using corrugated iron sheets. The developer has been stopped from going on with the fencing and a sign board has been erected on the land, indicating it is a protected area and part of the State Lodge. GSU officers have been deployed to guard the land and ensure there are no intruders. Last week, police from Uasin Gishu arrested three people who were erecting the fence around the land. Those arrested said they had been sent by a former State House official, who claims to own part of the State Lodge land. This comes amid ongoing investigations into how more than 4,000 acres of land belonging to KDF was grabbed at Moi Barracks. Area police boss Richard Omanga said they are investigating the matter. Omanga said those arrested have been released after questioning.
