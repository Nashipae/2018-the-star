On Monday, President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the Kenya Coast Guard Service to increase efficiency in protecting the maritime resources. “The Coast Guard Service will enhance protection of the country’s waters against dumping of harmful wastes and pollutants and help in curbing illegal fishing,”the President said. According to Unep, about eight million tonnes of plastic ends up in  the ocean every year. Kamau said Blue Economy is a new frontier for development as Kenya moves towards tapping into the productive capacity of water resources and empowering communities in a sustainable way. It will be anchored on the pillars of sustainability, climate change, pollution, job creation and poverty alleviation, under the theme, ‘Blue Economy and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development’. The three-day conference will attract close to 6,000 participants from the international, government and private sector institutions. “The conference presents opportunities for economic growth, especially sectors such as fisheries, tourism, maritime transport, off-shore mining, in a way that the land economy has failed to do,” the PS said.
