Eldoret town is set to host the 19th edition of the annual East African Community Jua Kali/Nguvu Kazi Exhibition. Themed ‘Buy micro, small and medium enterprises (MSEs) products, build East Africa’, it will run from December 1 to 18 at Eldoret Sports Club, according to director general customs and trade at the EAC Secretariat, Kenneth Bagamuhunda. So far 1,100 artisans have registered and confirmed their participation for the annual event that exposes products manufactured in the region. Organised on a rotational basis by the EAC Secretariat, the East African Confederation of Informal Sector Organisation (EACISO) in collaboration with EAC Partner States, the event brings together artisans from the six EAC partner states comprising Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. The first exhibition was held in Arusha in November 1999 during the historic signing of the treaty for the Establishment of the EAC. Subsequent to the success of the Arusha exhibition, the EAC heads of state directed that the exhibition be held annually to enhance economic integration in East Africa. To participate, exhibitors are required to register with their respective organizations and Ministries of Trade and Industry, while those in Kenya should register with the Small and Medium Enterprises Authority. During the Exhibition daily symposia will be conducted to build the capacity of the artisans on integration matters. During the symposia, Kenya will present on cross border trade, simplified trade regime and dealing with non-trade barriers while Tanzania is expected to do a presentation on value addition. Rwanda will present on standards, quality assurance, metrology and testing with Uganda dealing with benefits and opportunities from EAC integration to SMEs.
