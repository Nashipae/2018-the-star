A man who lost a case last week seeking the exhumation of former Nyanza Provincial Commissioner Isaiah Cheluget has said he will petition the Court of Appeal. Moses Cheruiyot, 37, came out last year when the former PC died demanding recognition as one of his sons and heirs. “I respect what the High Court judge sitting in Bomet decided but I am not satisfied and would be appealing the case in the Court of Appeal,” Cheruiyot said. Last week, the family received reprieve after the case was thrown out by Justice Martin Muya. Cheruiyot petitioned the court to order the exhumation of Cheluget to remove samples for DNA testing. Justice Muya dismissed the petition, saying the exhumation was not warranted in matters of succession. “It is my considered view that orders for exhumation for the purpose of taking DNA samples to ascertain the paternity in matters succession is clearly not warranted. I accordingly refuse to grant the orders sought,” Justice Muya ruled. Muya said the petitioner does not have to prove his paternity with the deceased for the purpose of inheritance. “There is no good reason therefore for purposes of succession to subject n already interred body to be disinterred for purposes of DNA testing to prove paternity,” Jutice Muya added in his ruling. Kipkirui wanted the court to order the government chemist in conjunction with parties representatives to extract from the deceased’s remains appropriate specimens for purposes of DNA testing. He also wanted the court to issue a declaration confirming that he is a biological son of the deceased as well as one of his heirs. He cited the wife of former PC Rael Cheluget and his son Johnstone Langat as the respondents. Kipkirui told the court his mother Jane Cherono swore an affidavit in the case that the late PC was his biological father. The court heard that the deceased met Cherono in 1983 when she was a student at Kyogon. Click here for the latest political news
