Kenya coach Paul Murunga has set a target of 10 points for each of the opening two legs of the World Sevens Series in Dubai and Cape Town next month. Murunga said he was satisfied with the team’s performance in the just concluded Safari Sevens, where Shujaa lost 21-14 to Samurai in the final with Kenyan Morans beating Spain 12-5 to settle for the third/fourth play-off match. “This was a high calibre tournament. Spain, Portugal and Samurai, they have very excellent players and I believe our two teams were competitive and it bodes well for the two opening tournaments in Dubai,” added Murunga. Shujaa face Fiji, France and Scotland in Dubai in a pool Murunga has described as tricky for the team. “It’s an interesting pool and we will take one game at a time and hopefully, qualify for the quarters,” he added. Murunga singled out Eden Agero and Dennis Ombachi, who were recalled to the team as some of the players who lived up to expectations. “Eden captained the team well and was our play maker. He led from the front and brought in experience alongside Ombachi and you could see the value addition to the team,” said Murunga. The tactician said the two still lack match fitness and will be required to attend more training sessions to keep pace with the rest of the squad who have been training for the past three weeks. “We have a couple of training sessions between now and the time we depart so they will be okay,” Murunga is expected to name his 12-man squad next week and announce his captain for the season. Murunga said five players, who are with Simbas at the repechage qualifiers in Marseille may be considered for the tournament in Cape Town. “ It will very much depend on whether there will be any injuries in Dubai but I can only pick two players from the Simbas for the event,” he added. Deputy President William gave Sh500,000 to the two squads by virtue of finishing second and third respectively and wished them the best of luck for the upcoming season.
