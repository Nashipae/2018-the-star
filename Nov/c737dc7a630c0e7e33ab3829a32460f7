Matungu MP Justus Murunga has denied depositing Sh3.9 million meant for women’s groups in a fixed account. The money was collected during a fundraiser presided over by Deputy President William Ruto on October 13. Ruto donated Sh2 million and also forwarded Sh1 million from President Uhuru Kenyatta. Ruto has visited Western on several occasions to hold harambees for schools, churches, youth and women groups as he woos voters ahead of 2022. He was in Kakamega last Sunday to hold a fundraiser for churches in Malava and for boda boda groups in Mumias East. On Thursday, Murunga said the money is in the bank and will be disbursed starting next week. He described the fixed account claims by Mayoni MCA Libinus Oduori as cheap propaganda. Waiting for pledge Oduori was roughed up at a funeral in Mwikunda village on Saturday when he made the claim. He had accused Murunga of using “poor women to raise money which he took off with” “The MP has placed the money in a fixed deposit account to accrue interest before he can distribute the principal to women,” he said. But Murunga said he had been waiting for the President’s donation which he received on Thursday and promised the women will receive their money soon. “We did the harambee on a weekend and the following week I travelled to Spain on duty,” he said on the phone. Trustworthy wife “When I came back, I was to follow up on the President’s pledge and that of others before the money can be shared out.” Murunga said he will meet the women groups’ central committee next week to agree on how the money will be disbursed. He admitted that he included his wife as a signatory to the account holding the money because “I wanted to ensure safety of the money”. “My wife does not benefit from the fund, but only makes sure the money is safe. I don’t just believe anyone,” Murunga said. He warned politicians against politicising development. He said those frustrating development projects are not fighting him, but the people.
