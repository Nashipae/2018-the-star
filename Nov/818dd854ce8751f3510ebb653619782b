The Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination kicks off today. A total of 664,585 candidates are expected to take the test with 10,077 schools being used as centres across the country. The KCSE exam is starting barely four days after the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination was concluded. Though KCPE ended without major hiccups, the unprecedented numbers of candidates who gave birth during the examination period are a major concern. The Education ministry has already ordered a probe into this matter. This should be done speedily with clear solutions to the problem. It is expected that the government will use the challenges and lessons learnt during administration of KCPE to effectively manage KCSE. Of utmost concern remain security and malpractices. Last year alone, the results of 1,205 Form 4 candidates were cancelled due to cheating. Yesterday, the Kenya National Examination Council raised an alarm over continued purchase and circulation of fake examination papers. This means that despite the many warnings by the government that parents and candidates should not be duped into cheating or any other malpractice, there are many who are still out to cheat. That is why the government should spare no effort to ensure administration of a credible national examination.
