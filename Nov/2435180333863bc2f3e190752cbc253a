Has Kenya Prisons men’s technical bench been saving the best for last as they seek to reclaim the Kenya Volleyball Federation national title they last won in 2016? Unlike in the regular season where the technical bench fielded upstarts, where they finished second behind local nemesis General Service Unit, coach Paul Muthinja revealed he will be fielding some of the unused experienced players. Muthinja said they are not in the business of gambling but they have their sight trained on the title. “People will be surprised to see some of the unused experienced players play at the play offs. If you recall, most of them sat out of the regular season not because they were out of form, we just wanted to give our upcoming players a chance to prove their worth,” said Muthinja. “So far our experienced players are in their best form ever and thus the team is at a better place right now. The players are all psyched up and raring to go knowing very well that winning title will grant them chance to participate at next year Africa Club Championship in Egypt,” The experienced players are Ibrahim Odouri, Hudson Chesoli, Daniel Kipto, Peter Kibata and Ezekiel Yebei. Muthinja said their performances in the regular season will count for nothing since the play-offs are a different ball game altogether. “You can’t measure yourself on your performances earlier in the season since the play-offs feature the top four teams and all of them want the title,” he added. “Therefore, we are not going to underrate any team but will instead take one match at time with the hope that results will come our way.” “I am glad there are no injuries reported and we pray to God to give us the strength going forward. We know it is going to be hard , but we are preparing well for it,” observed Muthanji. The former champions take on Kenya Defence Forces on December 1, Kenya Ports Authority on December 2 and finish the round robin tournament against GSU on December 3.
