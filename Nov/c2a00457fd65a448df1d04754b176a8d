Extra GSU teams were on Friday deployed to guard the Eldoret State Lodge after a daring private developer fenced off part of its land. The more than 10 acres are directly opposite the State Lodge and the area is usually used as a parking lot by guests to the State Lodge. Top police commanders, led by Eldoret East DC Norbert Komora and officials from Uasin Gishu, rushed to the State Lodge where three people were arrested while erecting a corrugated metal fence around the land. The men arrested said they had been deployed by a former State House official, who claims to own part of the State Lodge land. This comes amid investigations into how more than 4,000 acres belonging to KDF was grabbed at Moi Barracks.

Area police boss Richard Omanga said some people found fencing the land had been picked up for questioning. “We were there with my seniors but the matter is still under investigations because those people claim to have documents for the land. I cannot comment further on the matter, because it is still under investigation,” Omanga said. Sources told the Star the security team was surprised to find beacons erected within the State Lodge’s vicinity, which is a highly protected area. It is used as the President’s residence whenever he is in the region. “The people involved must be daring or well-connected because they have the nerve to move in and fence off land in a protected area,” a member of the Uasin Gishu security team, who declined to be named, said.
