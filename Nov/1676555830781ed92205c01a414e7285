Counties in the North Rift have proposed to buy shares in the New KCC dairy firm. They also want to buy stakes in the Mt Elgon Lodge and Kabarnet Hotel, which among 24 public institutions listed for privatisation by the government. Governors said the counties should be consulted about privatisation of public institutions in some of the counties. The county bosses included Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu, Patrick Khaemba of Trans Nzoia and Stanley Kiptis of Baringo. The Privatisation Commission last week released a list of 24 state corporations to be sold to help the country finance the budget. New KCC has factories are in most counties in the region. Trans Nzoia county has stakes in Mt Elgon Lodge. Kabarnet Hotel is in Baringo county. “North Rift is a farmers’ region and our counties have farmers with stakes in New KCC. We will seek to be directly involved in the privatisation of institutions in our counties,” Mandago said. The governors discussed the privatisation during the North Rift Economic Bloc summit in Eldoret. Present also were deputy governors Peter Lotethiro of Turkana and Dr Yulita Mitei of Nandi. New KCC is valued at more than Sh10 billion. It is fully owned by the state after being saved from collapse more than 10 years ago.
