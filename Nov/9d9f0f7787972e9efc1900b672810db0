‘Sexual favours’ and gross incompetence were among the main reasons that led to the disbandment of the Baringo public service board. Over 40 MCAs on Wednesday voted to disband the board terming it as immoral and incompetent. They said the board took advantage of MCAs who requested for allowances to ask for sexual favours in return. Among the allowances cited were those for per diems, foreign travel, fueling of vehicles and airtime. "Every time you demand to be paid your allowances as a female MCA the assembly chief finance officer Silas Kipruto would request for sex in return," nominated MCA Julia Kandie told the House. Kandie said some MCAs had fallen into the board's 'trap' since the county administration took over late last year. She said those who ‘gave in’ would be paid their allowances quicker as compared to others. The MCAs said the disbandment had come at the right time to save female legislators from the board members. Earlier on Wednesday, Silale MCA Nelson Lotela was hospitalised after he was beaten up by his colleagues during a stormy assembly session meant to discuss the board’s future.
