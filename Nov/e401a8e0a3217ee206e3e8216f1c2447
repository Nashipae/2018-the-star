After driving in the park on more than 4,000
occasions over many years, I remain in awe as to the incredibly wide range and
creative detail of the flora and fauna species that occur. In fact, the more I explore and find out
about the amazing diversity, the more I realise how little I actually know.
Every visit to the park somehow reveals something new and exciting to me. The unique natural wonder we call the Nairobi
National Park is only 117sq km, indeed a small area to support such a diverse
range of species. People like to inquire and find answers to mysteries of life.
One question that is asked by any people is: How does all this happen to be
here? It appears that there are two main
thought groups attempting to answer this age-old question. Some people think
that there was a “big bang” millions of years ago, and then somehow gases
cooled and converged to solids and liquids, and then there was an evolutionary
“soup” and then from that “soup” all living things simply evolved to be what
they are today. Another large group of people believe
that all living things are the result of a controlled creative supernatural
process with great intelligence and extreme detail that only God could achieve. I personally believe that the Nairobi
National Park is an amazingly wonderful creation that God has positioned right
next to the City of Nairobi for the benefit of mankind. The park is a priceless treasure, a wonderful
place for people to “escape from the city”, finding rest and peace in natural
surroundings. A place where individuals, friends and families can spend
precious time together and experience the healing “soul tonic” that comes to
many people who spend time in nature.
