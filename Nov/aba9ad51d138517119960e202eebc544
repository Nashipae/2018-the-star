The Auditor General has been reporting on expenditure by counties and has found glaring anomalies across the country. The Auditor has done well to get the reports for the financial year 2016-17 out in reasonably good time. This is recent enough to undertake remedial action. One problem in all counties stands out. Nairobi county is only banking 22 per cent of its revenue, according to the Auditor. In 2017-18 it received almost Sh11 billion but only banked Sh2.4 billion. The golden rule in running any business is to always bank all of your collections, even if you withdraw it immediately. Then you will know exactly how much you had and, hopefully, what you spent it on. Nairobi county spent over Sh8 billion in cash that was never banked. We will never have proper accountability for that money. This would be cause for dismissal of an accountant in the private sector. It should be the same in the public sector. Any county accountant should be surcharged if he spends money that has not first been banked. Quote of the day: "When somebody challenges you, fight back. Be brutal, be tough."
