The Kisumu Water and Sewerage Company (Kiwasco) yesterday unearthed an illegal water connection racket in the city that has seen them incur huge loses. Managing Director Thomas Odongo said the illegal connection was discovered when Kiwasco officials were undertaking a routine inspection in the area. Odongo said they are yet to compile a report on the exact figure of losses made but they suspect that the stealing has been going on for more than two years. The suspect behind the illegal connection is still at large after he fled when the inspection unit raided his premises. The suspect, who also operates a registered water kiosk in Upper railways estate in Kisumu, had redirected a line where he would get water from Kiwasco’s main water source. “The suspect had warned our officials not to excavate next to his premises since there were power lines passing underground,” Odongo said. This made the officers suspicious leading to the inspection which discovered the illegal connection. He said the incident has been reported to Kisumu Central police station for further investigations. The MD said the company is alert and on the look out for cases of illegal water connections across the city. Click here for the latest political news
