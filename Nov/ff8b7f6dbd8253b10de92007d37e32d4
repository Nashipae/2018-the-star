Nyandarua MCAs have accused county secretary and acting chief of staff Hiram Kahiro of trying to usurp the roles of the County Public Service Board and chief officers. The county government recently formulated internship guidelines and submitted the document to the assembly for consideration. Article 3 of the guidelines says the county secretary and head of public service shall declare and advertise the available vacancies. The Public Administration and ICT committee on Thursday said this violates the County Government Act, which assigns the role to the Public Service Board. Vice chairperson Wangari Methu, while tabling their preliminary report, said some “critical issues need to be fixed”. Speaker Wahome Ndegwa said the team highlighted “fundamental questions that might even raise critical and grave audit issues”. Contacted for comment, Kahiro said the guidelines could be changed.
