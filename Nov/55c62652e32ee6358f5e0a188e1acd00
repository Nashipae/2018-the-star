Former Lamu county secretary Siyat Osman has promised to market Garissa to potential investors if he is confirmed as CEO of the newly created County Investment and Development Authority. Osman was nominated to the post by Governor Ali Korane. On Tuesday, he told the MCAs’ vetting panel he will lure both local and foreign investors through correct information on investment opportunities. “This county is endowed with rich resources which need to be exploited but lack of awareness is the county’s biggest undoing,” Siyat told the panel chaired by deputy speaker Mohamud Abass. He called for streamlining of land issues through elaborate policies, saying the property is key in attracting investors.
