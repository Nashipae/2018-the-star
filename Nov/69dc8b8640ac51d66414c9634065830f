The car clearance backlog at Mombasa port will be resolved in five days, NTSA has said. Director general Francis Meja said the situation was caused by the lack of material for making number plates. He said in a statement on Friday that NTSA has taken measures to ensure no further delays in release of cars from the port. "We would like to assure Kenyans that the challenge faced in production of new car number plates has since been resolved," he said. He thanked Kenyans for their patience adding that vehicle buyers will now have their merchandise cleared promptly. Car buyers had sounded anÂ alarm over the shortage, delaying clearance of vehicles at the Container Freight Stations. More than 6,000 imported second-hand vehicles were at container freight stations in Mombasa over delayed clearance. Click here for the latest political news
