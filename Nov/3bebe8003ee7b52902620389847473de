The High Court has suspended two gazette notices issue by the National Land Commission revoking awards for Karimenu Dam II Water Supply Project, and for the Standard Gauge Railway Phase 2A Nairobi–Naivasha. Justice Wilfrida Okwany suspended Gazette Notice Nos. 11370 and 11371 dated November 1, 2018, that canceled the two projects. The judge further directed all the parties to file their responses in seven days and the parties to appear in court on November 20, for a mention. In the case, Activist Okiya Omtatah had challenged the decision by the National Land Commission to cancel awards for the two projects. According to Omtatah, Abigail Mbagaya Mukolwe who he said purported to be NLC acting chairperson went ahead and revoked the awards by issuing the notices. He argues that the position of acting chairperson does not exist in law hence the notices are invalid, null and void. “Mbagaya is masquerading as the holder of the non-existent office of the acting chairperson of the NLC,” Omtatah said.
