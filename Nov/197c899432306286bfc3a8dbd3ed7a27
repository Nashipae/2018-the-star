The world’s first sustainable blue economy conference has attracted double the number of delegates expected as Nairobi hosts the global forum next week. Foreign Affairs CS Monica Juma (pictured) said 11,000 delegates have already confirmed participation, exceeding an earlier target of 6,000 delegates. According to PS Macharia Kamau, government is looking to make use of all its water bodies, including the ocean, lakes and rivers for economic progress. “Most of our water bodies are hugely unexploited and not well conserved,” he said in an interview, adding that the government plans to replicate successful tourism and business ventures around lakes. “Lake Naivasha for example is a very small lake but the amount of economic activity around that lake including tourism, conferencing, flowers and horticulture can you imagine if we took that and expanded it?” he posed. Individual countries will also hold side events themed on technology, tourism, fishing business, manufacturing among others. Some 54 side events have been planned as at now. Among the forums will be the diaspora conference, which will look into networking opportunities abroad, knowledge sharing and how they can contribute to the local economy by investing back home. He cited examples of western nations having exploited the blue economy to international trade. “A place like Canada is a blue economy. If you look at European countries they’ve built their economies on the blue economy by venturing abroad,” he said.
