Kenya Police are four points away from defending the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League title after a hard fought 1-0 win over Nairobi Sikh over the weekend. Police were seeking to move to joint top with Butali prior to the match but with the win and the union’s decision to uphold their controversial 16-2 against Wazalendo on November 3, the law enforcers have opened a three-point gap at the top of the log. With two rounds remaining before the season closes, Police need at least a win and a draw in the remaining matches to garner an unassailable 61 points, hence retain their crown. Both teams have played 20 matches with the law enforcers testing victory 19 times and losing once—a result which has seen them gather 57 points— three more than Butali, who have have won 18 times and lost twice. Police are expected to travel to Nakuru for their next match while Butali face 2016 champions Strathmore University Gladiators next. Butali and Police will face off in the final league match on December 9. Meanwhile, the bottom four teams will leave nothing to chance in their final league matches as they stare at the danger of being relegated. With second from bottom KCA already relegated, the quartet of Sikh, Nakuru, Western Jaguars and Parkroad Badgers will employ all tricks in the book to survive the axe. Out of the four, two are expected be relegated alongside KCA to the Super League. Both Nakuru and Jaguars, who are tenth and bottom have 20 and 18 points respectively with two matches in hand while Sikh and Badgers have 23 and 22 points respectively with a match to go.
