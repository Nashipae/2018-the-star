Former Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi has lost a bid to have the incumbent Mohamed Abdi cross-examined in the case challenging his degree. The Supreme Court on Monday further ruled that Kampala University VC will also not be cross-examined on affidavits they have filed in support of Abdi. In a ruling on Monday, the apex court judges led by Chief Justice David Maraga said Abdullahi had failed to demonstrate that the ruling made on September 28, allowing the governor to table additional evidence, was obtained fraudulently or by deceit. The court had allowed Abdi to table his academic certificates stating that he was not given a fair hearing before the High Court and the Court of Appeal. The lower courts both ruled that the governor was not validly elected. "It is on this breadth that we must consider whether the appellant's right to a fair hearing and trial will be infringed upon by the denial of admission of new evidence," the judges said. Abdi said he was admitted to Kampala University in 2009 and graduated with a bachelor’s degree Business and Management studies. He further says that he obtained a masters’ degree from the same university and has attached a list the college's 2012 alma mater.
