A leading hair extensions manufacturer yesterdaydonated wigs to cancer victims who have lost hair due to chemotherapy. Wig manufacturer Darling donated the wigs to Kenya Cancer Association members, including Rose Chiendo, a cancer surivivor. “People gave me a strange look when Iforgot to put on my wig,” she said. Chiendo who is still undertreatment after a recurrence of cervical cancer was speaking in Nairobi yesterday. She discovered she had cancer in 2013 and started treatment in 2014, eight months later. “This was because of long quees at Kenyatta National Hospital. I received my first radiotherapy and chemotherapy in 2014,” Chiendo said. She said apart from long queues at Kenyatta, many cancer patients cannot afford treatment in private facilities. Many have no work, she said. “The disease recurred this year and luckily enough, the National Hospital Insurance Fund helped a great deal,” Chiendosaid. She has undergone six cycles of chemotherapy completed from June at MP Shah Hospital.
