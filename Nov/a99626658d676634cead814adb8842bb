A project was launched yesterday to help Garissa’s refugee-hosting communities that suffer deepening poverty, environmental destruction and social tension. It is part of a Sh10 billion project to help refugee-hosting communities in the Northeast. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa launched the Kenya Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project (KDRDIP), a week after it was launched in Turkana. The presence of refugees in Garissa, Turkana and Wajir has deepened poverty, damaged the environment, increased competition for resources, water, pasture and fuel wood. Host communities and refugees from Somalia, South Sudan and elsewhere are often at odds. The five-year project funded by a World Bank loan will provide economic support to communities that have hosted refugees for 26 years. They include Dadaab, Fafi and Lagdera in Garissa, Wajir South in Wajir county and Turkana West in Turkana. Speaking at the Almond Hotel, Wamalwa said the project will focus on community approaches to lessen the destructive impact of the prolonged presence of refugees. “We hope the project will improve self-reliance among refugee-hosting communities, social cohesion and increase the roles of citizens in decision making in development,” Wamalwa said. He expressed optimism the counties will benefit through better access to basic services, expansion of economic opportunities and enhancement of environmental management. He said this would contribute to the Big Four agenda. Wamalwa was reacting to concerns by MPs Mohamed Hire (Lagdera), Mohamed Dahiye (Dadaad) and Mohamud Omar (Wajir) who were dissatisfied with project planning. He said the project was signed in May last year and was to start in July. “We thought the project would be life-changing but nothing is moving and we have already wasted one and half years’ planning,” Hire said.
