Two more bodies have been recovered in Mai Mahiu as residents worry over rising incidents of bodies being dumped in the area . The incident has raised tension among residents who are concerned over possible cases of extrajudicial killings. In the first incident, the body of a smartly dressed man was found near a trading centre by members of the public who reported to the police. Just like in the past incidents, the man did not have any identification documents and his pockets had been emptied. “We have seen an upsurge in the number of bodies dumped along the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu and Mai Mahiu-Limuru roads in the last one month,” a witness John Wambugu said.  Two bodies were discovered in the nearby Ngumbi forest last month.
