Legendary Bango singer Joseph Ngala, famously known as Mzee Ngala, has condemned the recent ban on live bands performing during weddings and other occasions in Kilifi county. Addressing the press at his residence in Frere Town Mombasa, he said the ban will deprive live performing artistes of a living. “Why should they arrest us and we are just doing our job? My hope is that they should consider us and lift the ban,” Mzee Ngala said. The bango legend has contributed to the music genre for more than six decades now and inspired others like Gogosimo and Afro Simba. Kilifi banned music at night, including disco matanga, saying it is a great distraction to school kids, especially during this time of exams. Woman representative Gertrude Mwanyanje also blamed them for teenage pregnancies.
