Kisii county will sponsor a bill to protect soapstone carvers and miners in Tabaka, South Mugirango constituency. Governor James Ongwae on Friday said the bill will ensure the carvers and miners make maximum profits. He said middlemen have exploited the artists and miners for long and left them languishing in poverty. “We will not allow outsiders to buy soapstone products and stones from carvers and miners at throwaway prices, export them and end up getting millions,” Ongwae said. The governor spoke at Kisii Cultural Hall during the launch of two books titles Untold Story and Gusii Soapstone authored by Kisii University vice chancellor John Akama and his wife Marion Onyambu. He said soapstone carvings have put Kisii on the world map, hence, the need to protect the interests of all those involved in the industry. “We are going to use cooperative societies to market products for carvers in and outside the country to enable them earn good money and improve their lives,” Ongwae said. Those present at the ceremony included Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Prof Ratemo Michieka and publisher Matunda Nyanchama. Renowned international sculptor Gerard Motondi said if well marketed, soapstone products would not only improve residents’ lives but also the county’s economy. He urged the county to set aside a permanent display space in Kisii town to showcase carvings and to train the youth. Motondi urged the managements of Kisii University and Kisii National Polytechnic to offer more arts courses to provide more skills to young people. The sculptor asked the county government and the Ministry of Mining to provide machinery to help in soapstone excavation to minimise accidents and injuries.
