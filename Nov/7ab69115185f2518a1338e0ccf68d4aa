Kajiado’s ex-governor David Nkedianye on Saturday in a surprise announcement said he supports governor Joseph Lenku’s administration. Nkedianye said Lenku is the sitting governor and should be assisted to provide the services he pledged in his campaign. “Lenku is on the wheel, and as the sitting governor he should be given all the space he requires to run his office that was bestowed on him by the people of Kajiado,” Nkedianye said. The former governor was speaking at a thanksgiving ceremony of Orange Democratic Movement nominated MCA Grace Munei and her husband Daniel Kupai. The normally vibrant Nkedianye appeared calm throughout the ceremony as politicians present drummed up support for their political parties. Nkedianye, who went under the radar immediately after handing over power to Lenku after last year’s election, has never been seen in public gatherings for more than a year. He appealed to the people of Kajiado to embrace peace and remain focused in driving their development agenda. “Peace opens doors for development and this is enough reason to respect elected leaders so they can serve the people with ease,” added Nkedianye. The former governor did not indicate for how long he will support Lenku as governor or whether he will contest in 2022. Immediately after the last general election, Deputy President William Ruto engaged Nkedianye in a series of “talks” that led to the former governor dropping his court petition.
