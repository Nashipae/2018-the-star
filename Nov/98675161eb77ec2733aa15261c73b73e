Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) chairmanship aspirant Anthony Otieno Ombok aka Jamal has promised to revive the amateur game at the grassroots. Grassroots boxing has from time immemorial served as a feeder to top flight club sides but this has degenerated due to financial and technical hiccups. Jamal, who is currently on a countrywide campaign tour underscored the need to promote both the boxer and technical facets, adding that its through grassroots empowerment that the game will go places. He will be tackling his namesake, Kennedy Otieno ‘aka’ Kentrack, in the race to fill up the void left behind by incumbent John Kameta. Team Jamal made the sentiments after donating an assortment of boxing equipment to Gatugi Boxing Club in Central Kenya. “We realise that majority of upcountry clubs, including some from Nairobi, have been lacking the correct equipment and we feel obligated to assist our youth take their skills to desirable levels,” said Jamal. Jamal has pledged a raft of changes in his election blueprint which also seeks to revive dormant BAK commissions. Incumbent Kameta announced that he will not be seeking re-election a fortnight ago after the conclusion of the BAK league third leg event at Uwanja Wa Mbuzi, Mombasa County. Jamal has promised improve the technical capacity of judges, referees and coaches through right, relevant and up-to-date skills, adding that he will continue equipping boxing clubs with the necessary and right equipment. “We will increase inter and intra-county boxing tournaments to make it easier to identify boxers to represent counties and Kenya at various boxing competitions. We shall at all times strive to bring back integrity in boxing leadership and governance, through team work and reviving all the dormant boxing commissions while also introduce bilateral boxing club exchange programs,” Jamal added.
