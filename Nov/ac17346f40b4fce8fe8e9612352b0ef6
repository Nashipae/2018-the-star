A madrassa teacher has been jailed for life after he was found guilty of sodomising his nine-year-old mentally challenged stepson in 2016. Malindi principal magistrate Silvia Wewa on Friday said the boy had been repeatedly violated and the sentence “should be a lesson to others”. She said such cases are rampant in Malindi and urged residents “to report them so action can be taken”. The convict has 14 days to appeal. Wewa said a probation report revealed other cases of sodomy, which were not reported by the victim’s parents because of fear. The magistrate said the teacher took advantage of the boy’s mental weakness. She praised the boy’s mother for standing up to defend her child’s rights and seeking justice for him. The mother had reportedly received threats from supporters of the madrassa teacher. Muslim For Human Rights (Muhuri) activists and Sauti ya Wanawake Organisation celebrated the ruling in the courtroom. Muhuri’s Topister Juma said the court ensured justice, as similar offences usually go unreported  across Malindi because victims fear reprisal. She also thanked the mother for standing firm and speaking up against child abuse. “At times we had to take her to a safe zone because of threats. Let others with similar cases bring them forward,” she said. Muhuri rapid response officer Francis Auma said in a statement it will be “a lesson to other all child defilers”. “It sets  a great precedent that our children’s rights are critical and all should stand to protect them. Having worked with the family over the years on this matter, Muhuri will continue to seek justice and ensure the rule of law,” she said. Sauti ya Wanawake chairperson Helda Esily said the ruling was a success for the members who had sought justice for the child since the case began in 2016. She urged residents to report similar cases so culprits can be punished. All children must be protected, Esily said.
