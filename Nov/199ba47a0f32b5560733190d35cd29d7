Christmas came early for Bandari FC tactician Bernard Mwalala after belatedly being feted Coach of the Month for August. Mwalala collected maximum points that month to steer the coastal side to second place in the Kenyan Premier League. He was voted unanimously by the Sports Journalists Association of Kenya (SJAK) football commission after winning all the four games in August to bag maximum 12 points available. For his effort, he was rewarded with Sh75,000 and a personalised trophy courtesy of title sponsors Fidelity Insurance. “Belief of Players really helped us succeed that month. We had difficult matches but thanks to hard work from my players, we won all and this helped us finish second in the league,” a jovial Mwalala said after receiving the award at their Mbaraki Sports Club training base. To win the gong, Mwalala, who joined the dockers in mid-season from Nzoia United, started the month with 3-1 victory away to Posta Rangers, the broke giants Gor Mahia’s unbeaten run by handing the champions a 2-1 beating, went on to beat Tusker FC 1-0 away before winding up the month with a 1-0 win over his former employers Nzoia at home. “Breaking Gor’s unbeaten run was a turning point for us. When they came here, they were in top form after winning CAF matches and I told my boys not to concentrate on breaking the unbeaten record but to pick maximum points and reduce the gap between them,’ added Mwalala. With the new season just weeks away, Mwalala said he is lucky not to lose his regular players during the transfer window as he targets getting wins in the opening five matches. “Our strategy this season is to win the opening five matches then set a target. We were lucky not to lose any player from first team so it will be easy for me to continue from where I left. Mwalala has already roped in keeper Mustafa Oduor and defender Brian Otieno both from his former side Nzoia as well as Moses Mudavadi from St Anthony High School.
