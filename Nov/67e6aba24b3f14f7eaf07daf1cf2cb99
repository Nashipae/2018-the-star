Many people have always assumed the goal of the popular "No-Shave November" period is to only grow out oneâ€™s beard throughout the month. However, the real purpose behind the trend is to raise cancer awareness. Participants are normally meant to donate the money they would normally use in shaving and grooming their facial hair towards cancer-related initiatives and evoke conversation on its awareness. The goal is for participants to embrace their hair which cancer patients lose when they undergo chemotherapy. However, the long month event often loses its significance with most men viewing it as a competition to see who grows the best and longest beard.

Women can also participate by skipping their waxing appointments and let the hair on the legs grow. Brian, a Kiambu resident, says he is aware of the meaning of "No-Shave November" but is not doing anything about it. "I just have a beard which has been here for a long time. I am aware of the meaning but I am not participating," he said. University student Pierre Mwarangu says though he cannot grow a beard, he is not shaving his head for the whole month. "I will use the money to support and donate to cancer patients," Mwarangu said. "No-Shave November is all about not shaving your beard and pubic hair for a whole month," university student Cyprian Limo said. The trend has been a tradition for many years. It started when members of the Chicagoland Hill family decided to use it as a means to raise money for charity after their father, Matthew Hill, passed away from colon cancer in November 2007.
