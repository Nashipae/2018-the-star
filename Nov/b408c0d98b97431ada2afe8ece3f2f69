Four senators yesterday criticised their colleagues who voted to reject the report on the controversial Ruaraka land. James Orengo (Minority leader), Moses Kajwang (Homa Bay), Ledama ole Kina (Narok) and Johnes Mwaruma (Taita Taveta) said the rejection was a clear indication of “corruption fighting back”. Fifteen senators voted against the report, four voted in favour, while two abstained. Some were absent, but the rest walked out of the chamber. “Last week we had hopes it would sail through. Even in the morning, we had faith it would be approved, but we were surprised to see them walking out by 3.30pm. It was like it was pre-planned. They are cowards,” Orengo said at a press conference. Ledama and Mwaruma said the country had lost the war on corruption. “Cartels have oiled their path and there is no way Kenya is going to win the war on corruption. The DCI and the EACC, if you care about the fight against corruption go after that report,” Ledama said, adding Jubilee senators failed President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mwaruma said, “We’ve failed the President and NASA leader Raila Odinga. I saw people walk out one by one and felt disappointed. The fight against corruption is not about to be won. The President should know that his senators don’t support him.”
