The increase in gender-based violence in Kakamega county is alarming, Priscilla Oparanya has said. The governorâ€™s wife spoke on Tuesday in Matungu subcounty during an event to mark the International Day for Elimination of Violence against Women. Priscilla urged residents to join hands to eliminate GBV. She said the county is making anti-GBV laws and urged residents to report perpetrators to the authorities to ensure they are punished as a deterrence. Priscilla said a GBV rescue centre will be set up in Shinyalu subcounty and two others in the southern and northern parts of the county. During a UN-sponsored workshop two weeks ago, it was announced that Shinyalu, Khwisero, Matungu and Lugari subcounties have the highest numbers of GBV cases. Kakamega was identified as one of three counties nationally with high rates of GBV. The crime was attributed to alcoholism, cultural practices and lack of awareness. The most prevalent forms of violence include battering, rape and sexual harassment. Gender Affairs adviser Peninah Mukabane urged parents to be responsible and educate their children on proper behaviour expected of them.
