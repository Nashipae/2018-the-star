Beverage maker Coca-Cola will sell or rent out its regional offices in Nairobi’s Upperhill area 10 years after the offices were opened. The offices, which act as Coca-Cola headquarters in East and Central Africa, sit on four acres and was constructed at a cost of Sh700 million. Going by the current value of the shilling to the dollar, the premises can be valued to Sh1.03 billion. According to a statement from the soft drink manufacturer, the decision to exit Upperhill is in line with their Vision 2020 on workplace agenda. “The new office location will allow the company achieve a new modernised space built to suit needs of a more agile, and even faster paced business,” Coca Cola general manager Ahmed Rady said. Randy further said that the decision is a preparation to create an environment that will inspire its workforce over the next 10-20 years. The firm hopes that the step to shift will create room for them to promote and spur new developments in creativity, innovation and digital transformation. Speaking during the unveiling of the Upperhill offices in 2008, Coca-Cola company chairman Neville Isdell said they chose Kenya as a host of its offices due to improved communication infrastructure. Currently a leader in the beverages industry, the company provides employment to an estimated 13,000 people directly in bottling activities and a further 700,000 through auxiliary services within the supply chain.
