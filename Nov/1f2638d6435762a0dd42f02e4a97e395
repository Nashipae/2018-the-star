Gospel singer Mr Seed has dismissed speculation that his fiancée Nimo Gachuri is pregnant. "You are asking something that is not there. When she will be pregnant I will let the fans know. I have confirmed she is not pregnant," Seed told Word Is. This comes a few days after Nimo's fans asked her why she is dressing like she is hiding a baby bump. "Why have you been covering your stomach? Are you pregnant?" one fan wrote; “Mnataka ni tembee uchi (Do you want me to walk around naked)?" she responded. Adding: “You will all know when it is time to know. Mtoto hafichiki (You cannot hide a baby).” The gospel artiste proposed to his longterm-girlfriend Nimo on Valentine's Day, and they are set to tie the knot soon. Nimo said: “Msijali kutakuwa na representatives na hamuwezi kula mchele nyinyi wote. (Not to worry, there will be representatives because not all of you can attend the wedding).” Seed and other EMB record members are currently in Naivasha for a holiday, celebrating Bahati's wife's birthday.
