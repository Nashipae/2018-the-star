The Association of Women in Agriculture has condemned the illegal importation of four million bags of maize last year, calling it a a scheme to hurt farmers. Last week, it emerged that 10 millions bags were imported, although the government approved the importation of just six million bags. Speaking in Mombasa yesterday, the association’s national chairperson Judy Matu said individuals who exploited the system for personal gain should be prosecuted. “There is need to protect and prioritise the interests of local farm producer. The government must walk the talk and implement policies that cushion farmers from cartels in the maize industry, corrupt civil servants, politicians and their proxies,” Matu said. Agriculture Cabinet secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri last week said 60 per cent of the maize that was bought at Sh9 billion is unfit for human consumption. “It is sad the money was wasted to import the maize yet we could have bought it from local farmers,” Matu said. She said farmers had surplus harvest that the government could have bought. The maize importation was ordered after a rise in unga prices following maize shortage in May. Matu said there was no shortage at the time. She said the government should not neglect farmers because they are key to food security. She cited the delayed payment of Sh2.2 billion owed to those who delivered maize to NCPB. Deputy President William Ruto has said the farmers will be paid this week. “It is unacceptable that farmers should suffer because the government is withholding their payment,” Matu said. She said delayed payment of farmers is the reason behind the collapsing sugar sector. “Imported sugar was at the heart of the collapse of the industry. Farmers need state protection from cartels,” she said. The association urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to ensure those aiding the illegal importation are dealt with, regardless of the rank in government. Food security is part of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four for development.
