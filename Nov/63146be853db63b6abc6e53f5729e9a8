There are times when I really slow down to look for the really small things. After crawling along, my reward came in the form of some dung beetles rolling some dung. Watching them, it was very interesting to see just how hard they work, as they methodically roll the dung of animals like buffalo and rhino. So what is the big deal about dung beetles? What do they do? Well, apart from the immense good they do in the Nairobi National Park, let me take you on a brief journey to Australia to explain. In the 1880s, cattle were introduced to Australia. Eighty years later, by 1960, there was a massive problem with cow dung, causing fly infestation and large barren areas due to millions of hard cow dung patties. From 1965-85, nearly 200 different special bovine-orientated species of dung beetles from South Africa, Kenya and Europe were successfully introduced. The dung beetles aerated the soil and released nitrates in the dung, plus broke up the dung patties. The result has been a much more fertile soil in Australia, with less flies. So how about slowing down and observing the smaller creations, like insects (dudus), spiders and dung beetles, which all have a purpose as God made them? Insects are often seen as an irritation, but dung beetles are the “unsung dung heroes”. They humbly and tirelessly work to fertilise the soil, as they lay their larvae eggs in the dung balls and beneath the ground. Plus we should thank them for largely reducing fly numbers. Remember this: “When we look for the smallest, we also see the largest”, from beetles to buffaloes, etc. Bring your family and explore the wonders of the Nairobi National Park!
