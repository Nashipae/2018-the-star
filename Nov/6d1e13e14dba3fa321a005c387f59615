United States-based Rebecca Kamau leads a team of four swimmers to the World short course swimming Championship slated for Hangzhou, China in December. Danilo Rosafio, Ridhawan Abubaka and Imara Bella Thorpe are the other swimmers in the side for the five -day event. The squad was selected by the Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) Interim Management Committee based on the top Fina points in short course events for 2018. IMC head of the secretariat, Conrad Thorpe, said the four swimmers are expected to be competitive in their respective events and have already started training for the championship. “We have communicated to them and I do believe they will do the country proud in the event in terms of bettering their personal times,” added Thorpe. He said selection of swimmers to major continental and world events is being streamlined. “There is a database of swimmers we are working with in order to select the best swimmers and I do believe we have picked the best for the assignment,” he added. Elsewhere, Africa Youth Games swimming gold medallist, Maria Brunlehner, will miss the Cana Zone Three Championships in Khartoum, Sudan next month. The German-based swimmer will be sitting her examinations and will give the event a wide berth. Brunlehner, who also missed the Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, Argentina last month due to illness, is targeting a place in the squad for the Tokyo Olympics 2020. “I hope I can make the squad to the Olympic Games. It will be a dream to compete with the best swimmers in the world at the highest level,” she added.
