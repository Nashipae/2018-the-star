Kenya and Uganda riders are set to renew their rivalry in the second and final round of the FIM Africa Central Africa Motocross slated for Jamhuri Park Racetrack on December 8-9. The event will also serve as the ninth and final round of the motocross championship. Fast-paced Ngugi Waweru will be the star attraction as he leads a strong Kenyan team to the event, whose first round was held in Kampala earlier in the year. There has always been good-humoured rivalry banter between riders from both countries. Ugandans are expected to field the likes of Maxime van Pee and the Orland siblings (Stav, Alon and Avi), who are no strangers to Kenyan events having participated in some rounds last season. Ethan Nyachae and Kigen Kiplagat are also among the riders Kenya will be pegging their hopes on for points. Unlike in the past where all the three heats were all run on a Sunday, this time round, Heat One will start on Saturday from 10am onwards . Scrutineering and practice will also take place on the first day. The second and third heats will be run on Sunday. Practice session is scheduled for morning hours on Saturday. Ben Nsumba and Joshua Mwangala will lead the Uganda team.
