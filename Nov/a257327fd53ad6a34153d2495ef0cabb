Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has said proceeds of the maize scandal were used to buy three large RiftValley tea estates whose leases had expired. Keter said greed for money and power by individuals was to blame for the high level corruption and increased poverty among Kenyans. “The plantations belong to the people of Nandi and at the expiry of the 99 years they should unconditionally be returned to the county government,” Keter said. The legislator said he will stand firm and is ready to sacrificed his life for the poor. Keter also asked Deputy President William Ruto and his close allies to come out clean over maize and subsidised fertiliser scandals. “I know the same corrupt individuals could be planning something bad against the three of us (MPs) for standing against the scheme to defraud the nation, but let them know they will also one day go,” Keter charged. MPs Joshua Kutuny, Silas Tiren and Keter have blamed Ruto and his political allies over the current plight of the maize farmers. Keter said he was ready to die if that was the ultimate cost for standing with the “oppressed poor farmers” in Kenya. “I know I will be in the right books of history just like many other gallant men and women who have stood firm against corruption and social injustices,” the MP added. He spoke at Tigiyo Secondary and at Kelbui village in Cerengonik locations in his Nandi Hills constituency when he delivered a school bus. He said the future of the country was more important than the 2022 presidential polls and called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to stand with Kenyans. He urged Kenyans not to sacrifice their future over the 2022 General Election.
