Police are pursuing 13 suspected teenage Pokot bandits who killed a herder and made away with 22 cows in Baringo North sub-county on Thursday. The bandits aged between 10 and 14 years raided Ng’aratuko village, shooting dead 55-year old man Kapelel Arabal. “He was alone in the bush after other herders left for home around 5pm, the bandits ambushed and killed him before driving away his 22 head of cattle,” Baringo North Deputy Commissioner Joseph Opwocha said. Pokot residents say they have forwarded the names of the suspects to authorities. “We pursued the young attackers towards Toplen in Kapedo East and later we got their names through the elders and area residents,” a Pokot resident told the Star on condition of anonymity. The boys who do not go to school are the ones frequently terrorizing by killing and stealing livestock. “They receive military training by unknown people and they are assigned to raid. When they attain 18 years of age they get married,” the source said. Chemoe resident Richard Chepchomei blamed the government for laxity to beef up security along the porous borders. “Gunshots are heard every evening in areas of Chemoe, Kagir, Yatya, Natan, Loruk and Ngaratuko, meaning the criminals are hiding in the bushes ready to launch a major attack anytime,” Chepchomei said. In May this year another Tugen herder Reuben Rutto was shot dead by the suspected armed Pokot bandits at Ng’aratuko village and stole over 50 head of cattle. Click here for the latest political news
