The second phase of the Kachok dumpsite relocation will cost Sh197 million, Kisumu city manager Doris Ombara has said. Ombara on Tuesday said the relocation will take six months. The first phase cost Sh99 million during which 2.45 acres of garbage was relocated to the new dumpsite in Kajulu, Kisumu East. The second and final phase will involve clearing garbage from the remaining six acres. The dumpsite, near Moi Stadium, has been an eyesore for years. The second phase of garbage relocation was launched following certification by the National Environmental Management Authority (Nema). Ombara said the county has renewed Kenya Airport Authority and Kenya Civil Aviation Authority licenses in order to ensure there is legal compliance. “The relocation of the garbage will be undertaken by Naya Holdings Ltd,” Ombara said. Speaking when he flagged off phase two of the relocation, Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o told off critics, saying he was committed to making the city clean. Nyong’o said there were environmental and financial problems during the first phase, all which have since been resolved. “Our mandate is to change the lives of Kisumu residents and make it a modern city,” Nyong’o said. The county plans to build a children’s park at a cost of Sh135 million at the site after the completion of the waste relocation. The park will be funded under the Sh4.5 billion Kisumu Urban Project, a French Development Agency plan to improve infrastructure and social amenities. The county has already fenced off the 2.45 acres where garbage has been cleared as part of rehabilitation which also includes creating a model tree nursery.
