After finishing third on numerous occasions, Kenya Ports Authority men’s team will be hoping to go a step higher when the national play offs take centre stage at the Moi International Sports Centre indoor arena, Kasarani, next weekend. Assistant trainer Joseph Maina said they are keen on challenging for the title this time round. “Interestingly, we have been finishing fourth at the end of the regular season and third in the play-offs. To our many fans, it seems like we are comfortable in that position and it is time we gave something better,” said Maina. “We are not happy being in that position year in year out and that is why I insist that things will have to change this year. We are currently giving our all in training at the Makande Hall in Mombasa and we hope to be in the host city at least by Wednesday, if all goes well.” Asked whether the change of venue will affect the porters, Maina said:, “Actually, the whole development might be a blessing in disguise. Makande Hall has been hosting the play offs since 2014 and you can imagine the pressure that comes with being the hosts and the expectations from our fans.” “Now that they have been moved to Kasarani, we will be playing without any pressure and with this, anything can happen. We are going to give the championship our all. I am aware other teams are equally ready for the event and will be buoyed by home advantage but we will just have to wait and see,” he added. The official also heaped praise to the new signing trio of left-attacker James Mwaniki, middle-blocker Julius Lelei and setter Elija Bosire, all from Nairobi Water, whom he said have had a positive impact on the team. The porters begin their title campaign against champions General Service Unit on December 1, battle Kenya Prisons on December 2 and wrap up the three- day event with a tie against play-offs returnees, Kenya Defence Forces, on December 3.
