Christmas begins early as retailer Naivas launched a 10-week customer reward campaign to run until mid-January. The ‘Naivas yangu, krisi yangu’ campaign has weekly draws, branch-specific draws and a grand draw for customers using the loyalty card. Customers will win up to Sh1 million in weekly cash prizes and a grand prize of Sh5 million in the promotion running for the eighth year, themed Kikwetu. “Our Naivas reward card loyalty programme is helping us identify our customers, understand their shopping habits and in turn deliver products and campaigns that meet the exact needs of our different customer segments,” chief operating officer Willy Kimani said. “We aim to give memorable experiences customers in all branches across the country in this festive season.”  The retailer has had a relatively good year, opening new branches in several locations within Nairobi and around the country.
