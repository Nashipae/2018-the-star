The National Assembly Powers and Privileges committee has recommended that the DCI and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission investigate the sugar report bribery claims. The committee, chaired by Speaker Justin Muturi, found there could have been cases of bribery based on oral submissions by the members who appeared it. “There was therefore a possible breach of privilege and breach of the Code of Conduct by some members in terms of Section 16 of the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act, 2017, and also within the ambit of the criminal law,” the committee said in the report tabled on Tuesday. In August, there were reports of bribery during the debate on the sugar report with a group of MPs saying they
were approached with bribes to shoot it down. Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni wa Muchomba and Naivasha MP Jane
Kihara recounted how MPs were approached to reject the report of the
joint committee on Trade and Agriculture. Wa Muchomba claimed some MPs were bribed in
Parliament’s toilets while Kihara said some of her colleagues
received the cash before the report was tabled. Read: Sugar report: Muturi, MPs visit ladies' toilet to probe bribery claims Related: Gedi admits lobbying MPs to reject sugar report, wants Barasa punished Click here for the latest Political news
