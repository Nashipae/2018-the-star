Police have arrested 5,264 motorists countrywide for flouting traffic rules. This comes amid a renewed bid by the government to reinforce 'Michuki rules' and curb road carnage. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet said the operation will continue until order is restored on Kenyan roads. "As of this afternoon at 3pm, 5,264 traffic cases have been reported countrywide," he said. He lauded the crackdown on non-complaint matatus, saying the police have done a commendable job. "The public is encouraged to report police misconduct to the Internal Affairs Unit or IPOA," Boinnet said. PSVs are required to have inspection certificates, speed governors, a continuous yellow line, seat belts, insurance and matatu crew should wear uniforms. Before the recent crackdown, the government efforts to enforce road safety rules have been undermined by corruption and a lack of political will. Click here for the latest political news
