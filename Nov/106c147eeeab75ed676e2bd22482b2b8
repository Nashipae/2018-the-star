Ida Odinga, wife of ODM leader Raila Odinga, has backed the Gender Bill saying women should no longer be used as instruments of voting by politicians but rather given leadership roles. "We cannot just be use as instruments of voting when we can as well be leaders. Our role should not be limited to voting only but also to be voted in," she said on Wednesday. Ida made the remarks in her office after she received a delegation of Kenya Women Parliamentarians Association (Kewopa) who are lobbying for the Gender Bill to sail through. MPs will vote on The Bill sponsored by Majority leader Aden Duale this afternoon (Wednesday). It seeks to have at least 22 more women nominated to Parliament. "I appeal to parliamentarians to pass this Bill, it will make a difference in the lives of Kenyans," she said. "We have seen women who have been nominated once then get elected because they have gained confidence and know how to present their issues," she added. Ida added that women need to reorganise themselves on enhancement in politics even to grassroots level. She said that women have being sidelined and are facing may challenges in seeking elective posts though they are also well educated. "If things were right women would have a say but that is not the case. First they ask if you are married and to who you are married toÂ and most times women do not marry from where they come from," she said. The renowned teacher said a good leader can be elected anywhere irrespective of where they come from. Ida further said women need to support each other and urged politicians to change their manner of doing campaigns. "Elections in Kenya are very violent physically and verbally and this needs to change. We see money being dished out. We want our campaigns to be issued based," she said.
