The two-thirds gender rule Bill, which seeks to increase the number of women in leadership positions, returns to the House this week. On March 29, Justice John Mativo faulted Parliament for failing to legislate the constitutional gender rule one year past deadline. He directed it to do so within 60 days. This is not the first time MPs have disobeyed court orders on the rule. In 2015, High Court judge Mumbi Ngugi ordered the Attorney General and the Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution to prepare and table a bill for legislation. In December 2012, the Supreme Court directed Parliament to have a framework in place by August 27, 2015. The Constitution itself is clear on the question of equality as well as the steps that were to be taken to give full effect to the realisation of the two-thirds gender rule. Previous attempts have flopped because MPs either failed, refused or neglected to perform their constitutional mandate. We therefore urge all MPs to rise to the occasion and pass the Bill introduced by National Assembly leader Aden Duale. Failure to do so would mean anyone is free to write to Chief Justice David Maraga and ask him to advise President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve Parliament.
