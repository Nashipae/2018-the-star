Detectives on Tuesday arrested a teacher in Bungoma for allegedly defiling a student of Moi Girls High School Kamusinga in June. The teacher, Willy Wanyonyi Musikali, has been on the run since then. "He will be arraigned in court today and charged with the offence of defilement," the DCI tweeted on Wednesday. The arrest follows in the wake of DPP Noordin Haji asking the DCI to investigate cases of teenage pregnancies and early marriages. There were hundreds of such during the just-concluded KCPE and KCSE exams. He said the probe will start with Kilifi county, which reported the highest number, and be extended to other parts of the country. The Director of Public Prosecutions asked the DCI to forward the files on the same to his office for appropriate action. Haji said his office takes cases on children seriously adding that ODPP will work closely with the Judiciary and other agencies to expedite the cases.
