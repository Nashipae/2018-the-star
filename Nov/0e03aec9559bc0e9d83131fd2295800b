Matatu operators in Limuru town have demanded that their tuk-tuk counterparts be barred from the main stage. They said the operators have lowered the fares so as to attract customers. The affected matatus include those belonging to Ginyali and Lingana saccos, which ply between Limuru town, Ngarariga and Murengeti up to Nyambare. A Lingana Sacco driver, Stephen Njoroge, said they charge Sh40 from Limuru to all areas they ply, but the tuk-tuk operators charge Sh20.
