The KCPE results are out and nationally the results show a marked improvement over last year with over 12,000 pupils scoring above 400 and almost 235,000 scoring between 300 and 400. Simultaneously this was achieved with almost minimal cheating. Some 26 people, including teachers, were caught with leaked papers but they failed to get them to their pupils before the exams. And four impersonators were rejected. Cheating was negligible considering that over one million students were sitting KCPE. These are the most credible KCPE results for many years. The Ministry of Education is to be congratulated. Interestingly, these superior results were achieved despite a ban on holiday tuition. Schools had to finish teaching the syllabus by July and September was then reserved for revision. Having a proper holiday break seems to have helped pupils academically rather than hindering them. Schools also had their minds focussed knowing there would be no leaked papers. Their quality of teaching alone would determine whether they would succeed or fail. Merit has triumphed and that is good for Kenya. Quote of the day: "Nobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian." Goodluck Jonathan The Nigerian president was born on November 20, 1957.
