Igembe South MP John Paul Mwirigi has been arrested for inciting Bodaboda riders and probox drivers to oppose the ongoing crackdown on rogue operators. The youngest MP was arrested on Monday afternoon after he led the operators to remove a police roadblock erected along the Meru-Mikinduri-Maua road. He is being held at Mikinduri Police Station. After the arrest, the operators in Mikinduri and Maua towns lit bonfires demanding for his release. Mikinduri Bodaboda operators chairman James Mutwiri told the Star their protest will continue until the MP is released. On Friday, the MP together with Mpuru Aburi (EALA), Rahim Dawood (North Imenti), Moses Kirima (Imenti Central) and Kubai Iringo (Igembe Central) led similar protests over ongoing enforcement of traffic rules. He has been demanding the release of Probox vehicles impounded during the crackdown.
