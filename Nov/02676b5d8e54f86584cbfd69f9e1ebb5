A court yesterday banned Igembe South MP John Paul Mwirigi from stepping in Meru county for the next 14 days. This was after the MP pleaded not guilty to aiding a prisoner escape and obstructing a police officer from executing his duties. Mwirigi was charged with the two offences before principal magistrate Stella Abuya. The MP was released on a Sh500, 000 bail with an alternative of Sh1 million bond or surety of a similar amount. The court heard that he aided the driver of a Toyota Vitz escape from lawful custody after arrest. He is also charged with obstructing a police officer from executing his duty. Mwirigi was accused of throwing away a police barrier at Mikinduri, Tigania East, where police had mounted a roadblock on November 26. The arrest and charges bring to full circle the transformation of the lawmaker who barely 15 months ago was an unknown humble village youth. He became famous after becoming the country’s youngest MP at only 23 years after overcoming all odds to be elected as an independent candidate. The former casual labourer campaigned on foot and on a boda boda to reach residents who voted him in over the more established Jubilee candidate Rufus Miriti. Mwirigi, who could not even afford a suit after his election, caught President Uhuru Kenyatta’s eye who in September last year, handed him a brand new Toyota Prado. The youthful MP seems to have learned quickly the powers that come with an honourable member going by his recent acts where he forcefully aided suspects to escape from police custody and throwing a police barrier along the Mikinduri-Maua road. “If the accused person is released on bond there is a likelihood he is going to interfere with investigations going on to apprehend other suspects,” the prosecutor in the case said.
