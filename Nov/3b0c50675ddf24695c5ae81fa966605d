The sacco union is opposed to the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No.2) Bill, 2018 that seeks to introduce a new privileged class of Sacco members who are supposed to be outsiders-without savings. The Bill proposes introduction of Special Impact Members, (SIMs) through a special fund and investment away from normal Sacco contributions. Those special members are not accountable to other members through an Annual General Meeting. These special members will contribute to a special fund as determined by the investment committee, which is selected by SIMs and shall not comprise of members or directors of the SACCO. In a statement, Kenya Union of Savings and Credit Co-operatives (KUSCO) faulted the proposed structure, saying it puts Sacco funds at risk, leading to potential losses and penalties related to other laws, for instance Proceeds of Crimes and Money Laundering Act, 2009. ‘’Further, SIMs will conduct businesses, vote and share proceeds amongst them. The source of their Funds is not known and will not be known to the SACCOs and therefore, this is viewed to be against co-operative principles and practice,’’ KUSCO said. The union added these proposals are of grave concern to the sector, since they will distort the co-operative governance structure and create a second center of power beyond reproach within SACCOs. ‘’The special fund trustee is a body corporate with its own Memorandum and Articles and is not a member of the Sacco society. Currently, corporate membership is prohibited by Co-operative Societies Act’’.
