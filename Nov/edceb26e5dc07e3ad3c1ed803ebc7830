Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna said yesterday more than 2,000 students from his constituency have stopped their studies for lack of fees. Another 700 have dropped out of college because the can’t afford the fees. Most university students get funding from the Higher Education Loans Board to cater for fees. Nguna said the 2,000 students were forced to defer their studies after failing to clear tuition charges. The MP said there was a CDF kitty for bursaries but the money was not enough to pay fees for all students. “It appears most of the students from my constituency do not get Helb funding. I will to take up the matter with the board so that we avoid the high rate of drop out and deferment,” Nguna said. The lawmaker said dropping out of college was like spelling doom on the future of the youths. He said the students have a lot of potential that can be harnessed for socio-economic development. Earlier in a post on a WhatsApp group, Nguna said, “My attention has been drawn to a number of university drop-outs and deferment cases whose root cause is lack of school fees and upkeep for needy students.” “I would like to get details of all university students who have applied for Helb loan and haven’t been allocated the same so that I may facilitate their funding.”
