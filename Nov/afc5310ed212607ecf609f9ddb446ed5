Scores of passengers escaped death narrowly after their bus caught fire near Tsavo National Park stretch along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway on Tuesday. The bus belonging to Tahmeed Company was heading to Mombasa from Nairobi. "There were no casualties. We suspect the cause of the fire was caused by mechanical problems," Voi police boss Joseph Chesire said. The bus went up in flames when the driver stopped to check the vehicle near Manyani, Chesire said. Shocked passengers watched helplessly as the fire consumed the bus. Last month, a Modern Coast bus also caught fire in Mariakani. Only the driver and conductor were on board. They were going to collect stranded passengers. The two escaped unhurt. In August last year, another Tahmeed Bus with 39 passengers on board caught fire along the Likoni-Lungalunga Highway. No one was hurt during the incident. Click here for the latest political news
