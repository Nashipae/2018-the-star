Garissa leaders have asked the state to end clashes along the border with Isiolo where hundreds have been killed. Governor Ali Korane, Lagdera MP Mohamed Hire and MCA Mohamed Siyat said it was unfortunate that the government continues to do little as innocent residents are killed. Yesterday, two people were shot dead by suspected bandits. Reports say herders from Lagdera who were grazing livestock near Kambi Samaki were attacked by bandits near the border with Isiolo. A gunfight ensued, resulting in the death of two victims. Another man was attacked and seriously injured at Modogashe town in what was believed to be a retaliation attack.

One person is also still admitted at the Garissa County Referral Hospital with serious bullet injuries. Tension remained high in Modogashe and the neighbouring settlements following the killings. “These senseless killings need to be stopped immediately. The earlier a meeting is convened between communities leaders to bring peace the better,” Korane said. Siyat said the government should allow their people to arm themselves if it can’t protect them. “We want to say enough is enough. We wont just sit down and watch as our people are killed every day,” Siyat said. Mohamed accused Isiolo South MP Abdi Koropu of inciting residents. ”How do you explain a situation where a local political leader is captured on camera inciting his constituents and no action has been taken against him,” the MP said.
