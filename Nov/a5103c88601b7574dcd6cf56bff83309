Harmonize has called out MP Jaguar for failing to ask him why he did not perform in Eldoret before rebuking him on radio. "Jaguar should have tried to reach out to me as the artiste or even my management like he did to the promoters," Harmonize told Adelle and Shaffie on Kiss FM. "I felt so bad when I heard about him commenting on radio. Kama msanii, namheshimu sana na pia ni mtu anaheshimika pia na watu, and what he says makes a great impact on people. Yeye ni kiongozi wa wasanii ila sio wa promoters." In a radio interview, Jaguar said Harmonize should have performed for his fans who had traveled from far and wide to see him instead of failing to go to the stage, as much as he had not been fully paid. But Harmonize said by the time he wanted to go and perform, the audience was agitated and his management refused for security purposes. "Nilifanya hadi roadshow in preparation of the show na sound check and was fully prepared, but at 1am I was told the show will not happen because the promoters were to pay the contract which they had not honored," he said. "They had not arranged even my flight to Eldoret. I mean it was poorly done." Harmonize tried to talk to his management to go and perform but they refused because the audience was uncontrollable. He said Jaguar should have gotten information from his side and that of the promoters. "Nilihisi kana kwamba Jaguar amenibagua labda kwa sababu sitoki Kenya lakini anafaa ajue kua sisi wote ni wasanii wa East Africa. I respect his work and his music, which I started listening to when I was still in school. Things happen and I would have explained to him so well. He would have gone on radio with information from both sides," he said. Harmonize is in Kenya for Coke Studio Africa 2019.
