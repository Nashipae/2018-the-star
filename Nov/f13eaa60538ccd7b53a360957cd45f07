Homa Bay is keen to be declared an open defecation-free county. According to a report by the Health department, 74 per cent of families use toilets. Of its 40 wards, Kochia leads in realisation of the ODF. All its households have toilets. This was revealed on Monday when the county marked World Toilet Day at Odienya chief’s camp in Kochia ward. Health executive Richard Muga, Netherlands Development Organisation’s Samson Wachara and Plan International’s Onsmus Muiya promised to ensure every family has a toilet. Muga said they are committed to collaborating with all development partners to improve sanitation. "We’ve achieved 74 per cent in insuring availability of toilets," Muga said. He said availability of toilets would help eradicate communicable diseases and imporove healthcare through disease prevention. This will also save the county cash that would otherwise be used for treatment. "The partnership is part of health stakeholders’ main agenda of fighting the spread of cholera and other diseases related to poor sanitation," Muga said. They urged residents to wash their hands after visiting toilets to maintain hygiene. Wachara said lack of toilets is an enemy to the fight against diseases. "We are committed to eliminating communicable diseases, which mostly occur because of lack of toilets. We’re supporting the community to ensure they have toilets," he said.
