ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi wants the Kenya Revenue Authority to audit politicians donating millions of shillings to churches. Musalia wants the taxman to establish the source of revenue and if the people involved are meeting their tax obligations. He said the information acquired by KRA will also boost the fight against corruption as well as enhance the collection of taxes. “We have people in the country who are donating more funds than Safaricom is donating through its foundation. We know Safaricom is the biggest company in the region and such people do not have companies close to Safaricom,” Musalia said. The former Vice president was speaking when he joined his friends for a church service at Ruaka PCEA in Kiambu County. Musalia said KRA is struggling to meet its target because a few individuals have stolen taxpayers funds. He said Kenyans must unite in the fight against corruption so that everyone can good health, education and better roads. Musalia challenged Kenyans to embrace the opposition so that they can work together to ensure the government delivers. He called on churches to remain the moral compass of the society.
