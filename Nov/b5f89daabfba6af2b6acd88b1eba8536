"South Africa's High Commissioner Mr Thami Mseleku is meeting with them to discuss last night’s events. He will then engage Tanzanian authorities. Dirco spokesperson, Mr Ndivhuwo Mabaya, spoke to Ms Quintal this morning," the SA Foreign ministry said in a tweet on Thursday," Dirco tweeted. The Mail & Guardian said that according to Mabaya, there are a number of issues that the South African High Commissioner will want to be addressed by Tanzanian authorities.

Quintal tweeted before 1am on Tuesday morning that she and her colleague had been released. However, her family raised concerns that the tweet appeared as if it had come from Quintal whose Twitter account was suspended. "SOS we are being taken away for interrogation in Dar. We don’t know why. Taken Away from Southern Sun Hotel," she posted. Mumo's former colleague at Nation Media Group said: "They’re at the South African high commission. The Kenyan High Commission is also following up the case." Click here for the latest political news
