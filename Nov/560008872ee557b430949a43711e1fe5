Garissa leaders have asked the government to study the migratory patterns of nomadic residents to ensure next year’s census is credible. Led by Galbeth MCA Ismail Abdirizak, the leaders on Sunday said the census should capture all residents for the county to get its fair allocation of resources. Population figures are used to calculate county revenue allocations. Abdirizak said the ongoing mapping ahead of the census should not be used to determined where the pastoralists will be on the night of August 24 and 25when the census will be conducted. “Most of our people sometimes cross the border into neighbouring countries of Somalia and Ethiopia in search of water and pasture. It is important to know where they will be during the census,” Abdirizak said. He was speaking at a hotel in Garissa town on Sunday during celebrations of the Africa Statistics Day. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics is expected to use technology in the enumeration of residents. “We appreciate the technology but there is a likelihood of the data being inaccurate because the technology is manned by human beings,” Abdirizak said. The MCA said elected leaders will sensitise residents on the importance of providing accurate information about their households including the actual number of children. County statistics officer Katra Dahir said concerns raised by the leaders will be included in a report that will form the basis of next year’s census. Katra urged the leaders to support clerical officers undertaking the mapping for a successful census. County commissioner Joshua Chepchieng’ said there will be enhanced security during the national census. He said al Shabaab remains a security threat but that measures put in place during the KCPE and KCSE exams will apply. He appealed to residents to cooperate with police, saying the terrorists were still active in villages along the border with Somalia. Click here for the latest political news
