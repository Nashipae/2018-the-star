A Kisumu court has ordered the closure of Kibos Sugar and Allied Industries over massive pollution of River Kibos and its surroundings. Environment court judge Stephen Kibunja on Wednesday gave the orders sought by petitioners Benson Adega, Eric Ochieng and Bether Opiyo. The three said the company was emptying effluent into the river which they said is the main source of water for residents of Kisumu East. The company has been ordered to stop milling sugarcane, producing power and distilling alcohol pending determination of the case. Kibos Sugar and Allied Industries Ltd was listed as the first respondent. Others are Kibos Power Limited, Kibos Distillers Limited, Nema and the Kisumu county government. Kibunja said the matter was urgent. Interparty hearing was set for November 14 when boths sides are expected to bring evidence. Lawyer Frank Olel representing the miller said they will appeal the ruling because they were not heard. Olel said the closure will render more than 2,000 employees jobless. He said the firm pays more than Sh1 billion to the county in taxes every year. “We have records showing all the environment assessment reports by Nema and there is no basis for granting such orders,” Olel said. In March, Nema issued a 14-day closure notice to the factory after a raid by the agency and the county authorities found the firm in contravention of environmental laws. The miller was told to close down if it failed to implement recommendations in two weeks.
