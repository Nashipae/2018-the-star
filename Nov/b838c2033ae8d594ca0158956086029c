All heads of government agencies at Namanga border have been instructed to work together to stop corruption. Kajiado county commissioner, David Kipkemei (pictured) toured theborder post on Wednesday and met heads of agencies. He told them to work as a team. “You are the creators of this corruption vice here at the border because you want to carry out inspection of goods so that you can ‘eat’,” Kipkemei warned. He said the Immigration department, Kenya Revenue Authority, police officers and others will be working closely with each other to ensure law and order. “The greatest culprits here are the police officers who are mounting illegal roadblocks everywhere between Namanga and Kajiado towns. From today, I am warning you, there will be no police officer allowed to mount illegal roadblocks and anyone found doing so will be arrested and charged,” Kipkemei said. He said he has received many complaints from road users that they are stopped unnecessarily along Namanga/Kajiado route  by police officers whose aim is to solicit bribes.
