Former Machakos senator Johnson Muthama has said he is not against Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka’s new role in government. The ex-senator said he only questioned why the former Vice President called himself “mtu wa mkono” (errand boy) and that is what Kenyans want him to explain. "I said it is only Kalonzo himself who can explain that to Kenyans. I have talked to him and he has accepted to explain what he meant with that,” Muthama said. He said it would be stupid for anybody to ask Kalonzo why he took the job without consultations. Earlier, Muthama had been quoted saying, "As Kambas, we are pushing Kalonzo to become the next President and he is now running to the opposite direction with the relay baton." But on Saturday, he said it is not a must for the Wiper party to approve Kalonzo’s decisions. "Kalonzo is supposed to take any position so long as he is serving Kenyans," Muthama said. He spoke at Matungulu AIC church in Kangundo subcounty. "Why should he talk to another person for him to take the job?" Muthama asked. He said in Kenya only one person can unite the whole world and that is Kalonzo. Separately, former Yatta MP Francis Mwangangi said Kalonzo’s “mtu wa mkono” statement is a non-issue. He said Kalonzo used the term to mean appreciation to President Uhuru Kenyatta for supporting him during his father’s demise. Click here for the latest political news
