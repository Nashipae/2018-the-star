Mid-sized companies are set to benefit from Sh15.8 billion ($155 million) in an East African focused fund. Catalyst Principal Partners on Friday announced the close of the second private equity fund that attracted existing and new development finance institutions, local pension funds, wealthy families, and institutions seeking alternative investments outside the mainstream bond and stock markets. The fund succeeds Catalyst Fund I in 2009 that saw Sh12.7 billion ($125 million) invested in 9 companies in Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia with interests in consumer and retail goods, pharmaceuticals, industrial agro-processing, logistics and engineering, healthcare, technology and financial services. According to Catalyst CEO Paul Kavuma the increased investment by International and regional investors is a mark of confidence in the economic potential of the EA region. “Catalyst will focus on emerging and mid-sized companies with strong growth and profitability prospects. The emergence and mobilization of local capital marks the coming of age of the regional private equity industry,” Kavuma said. Companies that have acquired significant stakes of the fund in Kenya include Jamii Bora Bank, Goodlife Pharmacy, Mammoth Foam, Whitedent, Britania, Tanzania’s Zenufa Pharmaceuticals, Effco (heavy equipment leasing) and Chai Bora (food and beverage).
