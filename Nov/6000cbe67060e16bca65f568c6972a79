A top student from Baringo county who gave birth during the KCPE exams yesterday received her results without marks from one of the subjects. The 14-year-old gave birth at the Kabartonjo subcounty hospital hours before the start of the KCPE exams. The candidate sat for all her papers at the hospital as she cared for her baby. Yesterday, she received her results, which showed she scored 209 marks without those for the Social Studies paper. The girl and her family were shocked as to why she received her results minus results from one of  the subjects. "It was my favorite subject and I know I would have scored at least over 250 marks if I had my Social Studies results," she told the Star in her home yesterday. Her head teacher Isaiah Chongwo said he believes the paper may have been mistakenly misplaced in the process of collection and transportation. "I have already written to the ministry of Education to investigate and  locate her paper for marking and add the missing marks to her overall results," Chongwo said. He said were it not for the challenge the girl encountered while sitting for her examinations she would have performed much better. "She was among the top candidates at our school. She was hardworking and determined in class. I was expecting her to attain at least over 300 marks," the head teacher said. Meanwhile, Greenview Academy in Eldama Ravine produced the top student, Patience Jelagat, in Baringo county who garnered 430 marks. "I sincerely thank my parents and teachers for the time and support they gave me that contributed to my performance in the exams," Jelagat said. The 14-year-old was among eight other candidates at the school who scored over 400 marks. The school had a mean grade of 383.95 marks. Little Friend’s Academy in Mogotio subcounty was also among the top performing schools in Baringo County. The school recorded 12 candidates  who scored over 400 marks.
