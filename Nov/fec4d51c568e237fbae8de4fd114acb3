A motion by the Kwale County Assembly to stop two multi-billion shilling national government projects has drawn mixed reactions. The motion passed two weeks ago calls for suspension of plans to build the Sh34 billion Mwache Multi-Purpose Dam and a Sh20 billion port in Shimoni. Assembly Leader of Majority Raia Mkungu, who moved the motion, said the assembly has been sidelined, mainly on projects initiated by the national government. He tsaid the projects must be suspended to give room for comprehensive consultations and approvals by the assembly. “The assembly has been kept in the dark on projects which are seemingly undertaken behind a veil of secrecy by some individuals who have vested interests at the expense of locals,” Mkungu said. Consequently, the future e of the two projects in Kinango and Msambweni subcounties is uncertin. Residents have expressed mixed reactions, both forand against the MCAs and the projects. Kinondo resident Hamisi Ali supports a halt, saying exhaustive consultations are necessary before undertaking any project. “The move opens a new chapter in ensuring the rights of the ordinary people are not violated by implemneting projects after a long time of sidelining them,” Ali said. He said that MCAs should resolutly push to protect the interests of the people who voted for them. However, Binti Hamisi from Kinango criticised the assembly, saying suspending the projects is wrong as it will deny residents employment and a steady water supply. She said the projects will benefit the county. “MCAs should be concerned more about the plight of the majority of poor residents who look up to those projects to improve their lives,” she said. A number of residents interviewed said the dam projects will solve the persistent water shortage and boost food security through irrigated farming. Another resident, Musa Mazera, said development will curb the rising number of organised criminal gangs comprising mainly jobless youth.
