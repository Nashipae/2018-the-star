Renowned British supermodel, actress and singer Naomi Campbell is in Malindi, Kilifi county, for a working holiday. Campbel, 48, arrived on Friday and is reportedly doing photo shoots for an international magazine. The supermodel, who is the former girlfriend of Italian billionaire Flavio Briatore, is with a team of over 13 other people who are doing the shooting. Since she arrived, Naomi has been keeping a low profile, concentrating on the photo shoot. The supermodel is staying at Lion in the Sun beach resort owned by the Italian billionaire. Reports indicate that she has been to Sabaki River Mouth and Che Shale. Journalists have not been able to meet her, after the management said she did not want to give an interview or be photographed. However, her visit is a major boost to the tourism sector, which has lately been plagued by the abduction last Tuesday of Italian aid worker Silvia Romano in Chakama, Kilifi county. Five people were also shot and sustained serious injuries but are currently out of danger. Tourism players in Malindi are not worried about the incident, despite the cancellations it has caused. Recruited at the age of 15, Naomi established herself amongst the most recognisable and in-demand models of the late 1980s and the 90s. She was one of six models of her generation declared supermodels by the fashion industry and the international press.
