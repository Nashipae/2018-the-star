Thirdway Alliance and Haki Africa on Wednesday poked holes in the Gender Bill. Thirdway partly leader Ekuru Aukot said the bill is inadequate and contradicts President Uhuru Kenyatta's concerns about how expensive it is to implement the Constitution. “We call on our parliamentarians to stop the pretence currently going in in Parliament about amending the Constitution to bring equality between men and women via the Duale Bill,” he said. He spoke at the Haki Africa offices during a press briefing alongside Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid. Aukot said women should in fact make up 50 per cent of Parliament. “Women cannot be subjected to probabilities. They need respect and equality now. The Duale Bill, in my view, is diversionary,” he said. Deputy President William Ruto, ODM leader Raila Odinga and other top politicians have urged MPs to pass the bill sponsored by National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale. Aukot said he is satisfied with his role as the Thirdway party leader and will not bootlick for a job. “I want to assure you that I don’t need job. I’m very happy as the party leader of Thirdway Alliance of Kenya,” he said. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka recently asked to be Uhuru’s "errand boy" and was given the Special Peace Envoy role with his first assignment being in Juba, South Sudan. This came about a month after ODM leader Raila Odinga was appointed African Union High Representative for Infrastructure Development in Africa. These have been seen as the benefits of the March 9 Handshake between Uhuru and Raila at Harambee House. “We believe that the Building Bridges Initiative is a good idea. But really, I don’t think it can come up with anything new on what ails this country,” Aukot said.
