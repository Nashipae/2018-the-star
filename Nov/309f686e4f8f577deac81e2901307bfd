The leaking AFC Leopards defence could have finally got timely repair after the club completed the signing of Rwandan international goalkeeper Erick Ndayishimiye on a two-year contract. The club has in the past failed to nail down a regular starter at the department, conceding easy goals which have seen several custodians come and go in a fast revolving door. Ingwe spread their claws in the region and captured the shot-stopper, who was a free agent after parting ways with Rayon Sports in July due to alleged indiscipline. The goalkeeper, christened ‘Bakame’, boasts of several national team caps to his name and was part of the Amavubi Stars team which finished second during the 2015 Cecafa Senior Challenge in Ethiopia. The arrival of the former APR man is set to ignite competition in the department which also has former Chemelil Sugar’s Jairus Adira and the youthful Ezekiel Owade, who were alternated during last season’s silverware-less campaign. The 12-time Kenyan champions, through their official online portal, announced that Bakame had penned a two-year contract. “Rwandese goalkeeper Eric ‘Bakame’ Ndayishimiye has signed a two-years contract with AFC Leopards. Welcome to the den, Bakame,” a statement read. Earlier, the club had signed Zimbabwean forward Michelle Katsvairo and Isaac Kipyegon from Zoo Kericho while Clark Achuka was promoted from the youth team.
