More than 48,000 offenders have been arrested in the traffic crackdown targeting strict compliance with ‘Michuki rules’. The government has collected millions of shillings through fines. The operation started on November 12, disrupting transport in many routes as matatus stayed away to avoid being nabbed. It was launched by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i (pictured). The Judiciary has provided guidelines to help police deal with noncompliance. “No accused persons will be locked up in cells without first being granted time, place and adequate facilities to pay fines or bail,” the guidelines read, adding no offender should be held in police custody for an offence punishable by a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.
