Introduced to the world as a video vixen and later as the socialite who lightened her skin, Vera Sidika continues to be the talk of the town. Of late, she's been enjoying tremendous limelight due to controversial moments with her on and off "ex-boyfriend" Otile Brown. The two decided to showcase their love affair by subjecting it to public scrutiny, perhaps to up their ratings - a gimmick that has certainly proved to be beneficial to their endeavours. Yes, so apparently Vera Sidika is not only a catnip for the media but she's also letting everybody know that she's worth a lot more. Since she split up with the "Baby Love" hit singer, she's decided to get into music, releasing her first single "Nalia." It is just impressive to see how many views she's managed to gain five days after the video dropped on YouTube. Judging from this first track, Vera is not really cut out for the music scene. Nothing really stops her from doing whatever she wants, but maybe she ought to leave the singing to her former boyfriend. Actually, if you are a keen listener, you notice that she tries to emulate Otile's sound and style of delivery, but the result is quite incomparable to the original thing. Word has it that Otile really didn't want her to go into music, and maybe we have an idea why. Whether she's truly talented or not, the fact remains that she will constantly attract numbers and spark unending conversations. She already understands that she needs the flak constantly directed to her to stay relevant. Beyond everything else, she's placed herself in a position of prominence and adoration with young girls easily emulating her stunts. It's not clear if this music thing is a vocation now, but looking at the numbers, she must be truly happy. Probably, she just might decide to release some more tracks and surprise us all with some interesting collaborative efforts - maybe even with Otile. You can never be certain.
