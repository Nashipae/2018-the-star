Kenya Prisons teams (men and women) have been given tough targets if they are to feature in next year’s Africa Club Championship in Cairo, Egypt. Team management have insisted that the teams will only grace the continental events if they win the national titles at the Kenya Volleyball Federation national play-offs early next month. Both teams finished runner’s up during last year’s edition but the Prisons team management have insisted they will not accept to play second fiddle this year. The women’s team fell to Kenya Pipeline while the warders succumbed to General Service Unit. The two teams are currently fine-tuning their skills at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani ahead of the December 1-3 play-offs. Women’s captain Evelyne Makuto observed that they are doing everything possible to reclaim the trophy they last won in 2013. The left attacker said they are keen on featuring at the continental championships, where they finished fourth at last year’s edition in Egypt after falling to local nemesis Kenya Pipeline in the third place play-off. “As you can see, we are all working hard in training as we seek to finally win the national title. We have come close on several occasions but we want to right those wrongs and meet the conditions we have been given,” said Makuto. “We know it’s not going to be a walk in the park since all the other teams also want the title.” She said they are also keen on grabbing the title to show the young players in the squad the way as they continue to build on their career. “The experienced players won’t be here for a long time and therefore we want to set the stage right for the young players who joined the team from various schools this year,” added Makuto. The wardress start their title campaign on December 1 against stubborn Kenya Commercial Bank, face champions Pipeline on December 2 and wrap up the three-day event with a tie against newcomers Bungoma County on December 3.
