The decomposing body of a man who went missing three weeks ago in Kilifi was on Sunday found in Arabuko-Sokoke forest. Said Mwangirani, 42, disappeared on October 25. His body was found by a forest warden. Ganze police boss Patrick Ngeiywa said Mwangirani may have been killed somewhere else. Ngeiywa said police have been searching for Mwangirani for two days after his phone signal was last tracked in the forest. “There was no sign of struggle where we found the body and this suggests he could have been killed elsewhere,” he said. Police are looking for two others who disappeared the same week. Mwangirani’s estranged wife Margaret Thoya was among numbers he had contacted before his disappearance. She said she called Mwangirani so he could organise for transport for their three kids after they closed school. “We had issues with Said but we had not divorced. He was paying for the children’s upkeep and we were in constant communication,” Thoya said Nzaro Katana, Mwangirani’s friend, who was the last known contact person before his disappearance, said they had tea at a café in Kilifi before Mwangirani received a call and left without telling him who had called. He said they were walking towards Kwa Charo wa Mae when Mwangirani received a call and he told the caller they would meet at Kwa Mwango in 15 minutes. Katana said Mwangirani flagged down a motorbike and took off without telling him who he was meeting. “He had two A4 size envelopes,” he said. Katana said he is not aware of any deal that had gone sour to warrant his killing.
