Nacada board member Chipukeezy has urged Nairobi governor Mike Sonko to let the authority rehabilitate former World Boxing champion Conjestina Achieng. “Sonko has done a good job by offering to help Conjestina, but we would like him to hand over the responsibility of taking her to rehab to Nacada. His office can take over from there to find her employment,” Chipukeezy told Word Is. “Nacada has the facilities and we are the experts, akipona [when she recovers] we can hand her over to them.” Chipukeezy said he had already contacted Conjestina’s family and they had agreed to take her to rehab before Sonko stepped in. This came a day after an undated video surfaced online painting a sorry image of Conjestina, now reduced to a life of want and suffering in her rural village. Sonko last Friday flew her to Nairobi to get treatment.
