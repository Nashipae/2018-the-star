Four hardcore criminals were on Monday shot dead by police in Baraka area of Mowlem, Dandora. A police source said the ringleader identified only as Mutuku and his accomplices had been on the run for a long time. "They have terrorised Nairobians from all corners of the city; Mukuru, Kitengela, Kayole, Buruburu, Kasarani, Ruiru and Thika." According to the source, the suspects were shot dead by the revered crime buster Ahmed Rashid, popularly known as Hessy.
