Three children and a woman are recuperating at Embu Level 5 Hospital after they were mauled by a stray dog on Wednesday. They suffered injuries on their hands, legs, buttocks and faces. The four, who are from Nembure village in Embu West subcounty, include two boys and a girl aged between four and seven years and a woman who is 34 years old. The two boys and the girl were attacked while playing. The girl said she was playing when the dog appeared and started biting her. Emily Wambeti, mother of the girl, said she was at a meeting of widows at the Nembure social hall in Embu West when her daughter arrived crying. She narrated her ordeal. Wambeti said as she walked to the dispensary with her daughter she met other victims, a woman and and the two boys. Dionisia Mukami, mother of the two boys, said she was washing outside her house when she heard her sons screaming. She rushed to help but the dog turned on her. She managed to chase it away. The victims said they were not treated at Nembure dispensary and went to Embu Level 5 hospital for anti-rabies drugs. The parents of the victims have called on the public health department and other relevant bodies to hunt down the dog and other stray dogs and kill them. Many Kenyans who own dogs, cats and donkeys fail to appreciate the risk they are exposed to when they do not take anti-rabies vaccinations. Rabies kills at least 2,000 Kenyans annually, according to the Zoonotic Diseases Unit. Kenya Veterinary Association secretary general emeritus Kenneth Wameyo says vets and the government aim to rid the county of dogs-mediated rabies by 2030.
