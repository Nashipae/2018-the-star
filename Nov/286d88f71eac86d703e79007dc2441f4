A woman died in Rhamu, Mandera North, on Monday night after she was allegedly shot by police officers on patrol. Police were pursuing a person who was selling bhang in a residential area when they shot the woman, witnesses said. Youth yesterday took to the streets to protest against what they called police brutality following the woman’s death. Resident Abdi Hassan said the woman was shot after she ignored orders to stop. “We regret that we have lost one of us to police brutality. This should not have happened as the woman was unarmed,” Gedow said. Mandera North deputy county commissioner Kiplagat Tarus yesterday said normalcy has returned and police are doing everything possible to prevent further loss of life. He said he could not immediately ascertain what led to the killing.Tarus said investigators from Mandera town are in Rhamu to establish what happened. He said he has been meeting MCAs, clerics and elders to restore calm. Two weeks ago, Mandera governor Ali Roba led area political leaders in celebrating peaceful co-existence. In 2013, Rhamu was the epicentre of clan clashes pitting the Garre and Degodia clans.
