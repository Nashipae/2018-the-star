Kenyans Ruth Chepngetich and Felix Kimutai set new course records while winning the 40th intercontinental Istanbul Marathon titles yesterday. Chepngetich, last year’s winner fi nished, clocked 2 hours, 18 minutes and 35 seconds while Kimutai timed 2 hours, 9 minutes and 57 seconds. Meanwhile, Magdalene Masai emerged victorious from a three-woman rivalry to break the course record at the Hefei International Marathon in her debut over the distance yesterday. The 24-year-old Masai, who owns a half marathon personal best of 1:07:31, clocked a winning mark of 2:28:20 under cool and cloudy weather conditions, improving the course record set by countrywoman Grace Momanyi two years ago by six seconds. Local runner Li Dan took a brave early solitary lead soon after the gun, hitting the 10km mark in 35:05 and 15 kilometres in 52:55 with her advantage growing to nearly a minute. But a chasing group comprising of six African runners gradually reeled her in after 20km, and the 23-year-old Li, a 2:33:37 performer, was fi nally caught at 24 kilometres. When the leaders passed the water tables at 30 kilometres only three runners were left in contention of the title, including Masai, Kenya’s Racheal Mutgaa and Ethiopian preevent favourite Aberash Fayesa, who was the fastest entrant with a career best of 2:27:04. Fayesa was the first to drop back before 40 kilometres. Masai pulled clear from Mutgaa a kilometre later and the in-form Kenyan never looked back until crossing the line in style. Mutgaa fi nished second in 2:28:37, improving her lifetime best by more than one-and-a-half minutes. Fayesa fi nished third in 2:29:03. The men’s race also saw a surprising winner as Kenya’s Leonard Langat cut 3:20 from his PB to claim the title with in 2:10:48. It was only the third international marathon race for Langat whose two previous races both came in 2014. His focus in recent years was mainly over the half marathon where he was a PB of 59:18.
