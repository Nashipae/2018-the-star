Nominated MP David Sankok has told Sports Cabinet Secretary Richard Echesa to pay the Kenya amputee football team's Sh2.3 million allowances or be impeached. He said it was shameful for the team to spend the night at the CS's boardroom on Thursday. Sankok told the Star in Narok town on Saturday sports officials linked to the mistreatment of the team should be punished for the mess. “This team should get its rights. It represented the country,” he said. Sankok represents persons living disabilities in Parliament. The team competed at the Amputee World Cup in Mexico and finished 12th overall and second in Africa. Sankok told the CS to prepare to go home if he does not pay the team in full this week. He promised to table the matter in Parliament. “They should be proud of the team. The players deserved a warm reception, not sleeping in the boardroom. National football team Harambee Stars has never achieved such results,” he said. Sankok told Echesa to tread cautiously lest he face the same fate as his predecessor Ali Wario. On Friday, the CS met the team and promised to pay its dues. Click here for the latest political news
