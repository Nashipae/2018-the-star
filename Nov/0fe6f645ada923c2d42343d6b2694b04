Four suspected rustlers were lynched in Kitengela and their truck burnt down on Friday. An accomplice escaped. Owner of the cows, Kunini Mwanta, said the suspects stormed his manyatta in the morning and drove off with nine cows and a bull. “My dogs continuously barked and my sons found the cows missing when they checked. They raised alarm and and the thieves were pursued,” Mwanta said. The theft occurred at his home in Korrompoi in Kaputiei North ward. The cows were driven towards the Export Processing Zone in Athi River. The thieves loaded the cows in the truck during the theft at about 4.30am. Irate morans and villagers caught up with the thieves and a shooting exchange ensued. The cows were recovered. Isinya police boss Kinyua Mugambi said the four suspects were pronounced dead upon arrival in hospital. “We picked them up and rushed them to hospital but doctors declared them dead. One suspect escaped with injuries,” Mugambi said. Witnesses said the thieves surrendered after some villagers arrived armed with licensed guns. Two weeks ago, Kitengela OCS Renson Gambo declared he would personally handle thuggery and rustling that has caused suffering to pastoralists in Korrompoi. Although he was not involved in the recovery of the stolen livestock, Gambo had complained that more than 200 cows and 3,000 sheep had been reportedly stolen in Korrompoi in the past five months.
