MPs from Mount Kenya on Thursday presented President Uhuru Kenyatta
with a memorandum protesting that their counties have not benefitted
from his presidency. They lamented that very few national
projects have been implemented in their backyards and urged the
President to use his remaining period in office to channel development
projects their way. But in a quick rejoinder, the President asked what they have individually done for their voters. In
his inaugural speech in 1961, American President John F. Kennedy 
said, "My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you,
ask what you can do for your country." It's sad that in the sixth year of devolution, Kenyan leaders and citizens are still conditioned that development can only come from the centre. To
the contrary, prudent use of the National Government Constituency Fund, Affirmative Action Fund, County Government's
Shareable Revenue, County Government Conditional Grants and Roads
Maintenance Levy could propel these regions to greatness. How many
projects has Uhuru initiated in Makueni county? Yet the region is
becoming a case study in how devolution can transform an area. As the President rightly said, MPs — not just
those from Mt Kenya — must roll up their sleeves, make good use of
budgetary allocations and employ ingenuity to drive development. The era of banking on our wo(man) at State House or manna from the state is long gone.
