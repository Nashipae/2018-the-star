Kenya Cane last week unveiled “Shangilia Hustle ya Kenya”, a consumer promotion offering gifts and funds to boost upcoming businesses. Twenty lucky consumers will walk away with Sh100,000 merchandise, while another 24,000 lucky winners will get instant cash prizes. The 12-week campaign is the second phase of an initiative launched last year. Present were KBL head of spirits Anne Muhoro and senior brand manager spirits Walter Githongo. The event was hosted by Oga Obinna, while DJ Hassan entertained the revellers.
