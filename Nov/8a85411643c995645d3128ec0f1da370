Most Public Service Vehicle operators in Kirinyaga county kept off the road yesterday as they had not yet complied with the Michuki Rules. The Star established that the few PSVs that had complied with the rules had hiked fares. Fares between Kerugoya and Nairobi were increased from Sh300 to Sh500 due to shortage of vehicles but bus fares within towns in the county remained as usual. Kukena sacco coordinator Robinson Chomba said they support the government’s effort to restore order to the sector and said they don’t support a strike called by the Matatu Owners Association. “We support the government 100 per cent, but let the law enforcement officers implement the law without discrimination,’’ Chomba said He said vehicles operating under the sacco have all complied with transport rules. 4NTE Sacco Chairman Njagi Ngari said the sacco had complied with the rules and supports the government crackdown to prevent accidents that have caused deaths on the roads. “Some drivers tamper with speed governors so they can make more trips and extra cash for themselves. Let police enforce the law,” he said Ngari complained that while PSV vehicles comply with the law, private cars operate with impunity. “Private vehicles operate with impunity, sometimes with five people in the driver’s compartment,’’ Ngari said. Saccos that pulled off the road include 2NK sacco, Mount Kenya sacco and Supreme shuttle — all operating between Kerugoya and Nairobi. An official of 2NK sacco, James Kamandi, said they pull off the road since they fear police harassment.
