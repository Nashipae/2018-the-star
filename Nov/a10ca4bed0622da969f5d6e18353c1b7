Two Rift Valley politicians have urged Baringo senator Gideon Moi to shelve his 2022 presidential ambitions and back DP William Ruto. Nandi senator Samson Cherargei and Bureti MP Japheth Mutai said Rift Valley people are solidly behind the DP for President. The two spoke at separate forums at the weekend, when they pledged to mobilise residents to support Ruto. “The Rift Valley people know Ruto is our leader. Others are non-starters. At the moment, Ruto is closest to the power,” Mutai in Kericho town on Saturday. The MP said those forming alliances or entering into pacts to scuttle the DP’s bid for the top office will not succeed. “It is common knowledge that the DP is the next President,” the MP said. Cherargei on Friday called Gideon a “spoiler” and said Ruto is the front runner. He said the Baringo senator should not compete with Ruto. The DP has been crossing the county, launching development projects.
