Matatu operators in Lodwar on Thursday complained of low cashflow following the crackdown on non-compliant matatus. Non-compliant vehicles plying the Kitale, Lokichar, Lodwar, Kakuma and Lokichogio have been withdrawn from the roads. In an interview with the Star on Wednesday, Turkana Director of Trade James Lokwale said transport has been disrupted because most PSVs have not complied with ‘Michuki rules’. Business has declined in Lokichar, Kainuk, Kakuma and Lokichogio, he said. Matatu operators in Lodwar town are counting losses. Eldoret Express manager John Kimani said business is very low. He said the firm is only operating two buses between Lodwar and Kitale. "We do not oppose the rules, will soon comply with them and return to business as usual," Kimani said. Lodwar Classic manager Dan Otieno said they have lost business because most of their vehicles did comply on time. "At least five vehicles used to leave Kitale every morning for Lodwar. But now we don't have enough passengers to fill even two vehicles in a day," he said. He said passengers are afraid to travel because they may be caught up in the crackdown. Otieno said the firm has not raised fare from Kitale to Lodwar, which remains at Sh1,500. Click here for the latest political news
