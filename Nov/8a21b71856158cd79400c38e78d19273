Nominated MCAs, especially women, are not pulling their weight in the Kisii assembly and they should be removed from committees, an elected male MCA has said. Paul Angwenyi of Sensi said he will table a motion to deny privileges to nominated MCAs on grounds they make little or no contributions. Speaking outside the assembly on Wednesday, Angwenyi said nominated MCAs, mostly women, either arrive late or not at all. However, nominated MCAs protested they are treated like “lesser beings” by their elected colleagues. In a statement read by MCA Caren Mgara, they said they are being discriminated against by being denied three employees each as required by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC). They also complained that they have not been allocated office space.
