The government plans to increase irrigated land for growing maize by 200,000 acres to address the perennial shortage in the country. With the country’s annual consumption of maize standing at 52 million bags, the Ministry of Agriculture says it’s possible to increase production from the current 40 million to 67 million bags by 2022. Irrigation PS Fred Segor said the government imports maize from neighbouring countries because of inability to meet demand. He spoke at the Engineering Partnership Convention held at Sawela Lodge in Naivasha. It forum is organised by the Engineers Board of Kenya. Prof Segor said the government also plans planned to increase rice production from 112,800 to 408,486 metric tonnes by the same period. "The current annual rice consumption is 538,370 metric tonnes and plans are underway to expand land under rice irrigation by 1,000 acres by 2019," he said. Segor said engineers play a crucial role in the country’s development. He asked them to be proactive in policy making and to assist in innovation mainly in the water sector. "Plans are underway to reduce the number of food insecure Kenyans from 5 million to 10 million," said the PS. Segor said the National Irrigation Board will construct of an additional 1,000 water pans in the counties. Click here for the latest political news
