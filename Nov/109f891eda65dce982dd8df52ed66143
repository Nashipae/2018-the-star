Kitui county has honoured former Kitui mayor Martha Mwangangi, who was crushed to death on December 15, 2016, during a protest by Kitui traders. A Sh15 million ward at the Kitui Level 4 Hospital has been named after her. On Wednesday, Governor Charity Ngilu launched the Hon Martha Mwangangi Amenity Ward. She said Mwangangi was committed to improving lives of residents. On the day she died, Mwangangi and Ngilu had stood in solidarity with traders whose stalls were razed by the Julius Malombe administration. A fire engine drove into the crowd, running her down. She died on the spot. Ngilu barely survived after her guard shoved her aside. Ngilu said the ward marked a crucial chapter in her administration’s healthcare plans. She said it would offer high-quality services. “The ward has been developed to the best standards. Services will be offered by specialists,” she said.
