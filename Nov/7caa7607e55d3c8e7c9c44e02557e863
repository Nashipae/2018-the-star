The National Authority for the Campaign against Drug Abuse (Nacada) will sponsor the rehabilitation of a former army officer who was laid off over alcoholism. Stanley Gachie,36, was recruited into the army in 2002 and lost his job in 2010 after his drinking sprees resulted to abdication of duty. “My wife left me with our two daughters, soon after I was sacked which made my situation even worse,” Gachie said. Speaking at Faith memorial treatment and rehab centre in Murang’a during Gachie’s admission, Nacada chairman Julius Githiri said they are identifying other needy cases whose rehabilitation will be sponsored according to availability of funds. Githiri said there are over 85 licensed rehabilitation centres in the country majority of which are enlisted with NHIF.
