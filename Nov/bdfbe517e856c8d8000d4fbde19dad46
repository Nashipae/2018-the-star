A section of clerics and traders in Murang’a county have called on Deputy President William Ruto to pick Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru as his running mate. They endorsed Waiguru whom they said is the only woman in the Mt Kenya region who can take over the baton from President Uhuru Kenyatta as Central Kenya’s political kingpin. This comes as political majors in the Mt Kenya region jostle on who will fit in Uhuru’s shoes come 2022. Speaking after a meeting in Kenol town on Saturday, the clerics and businessmen (pictured) said that it is high time Mt Kenya region accepted and supported women leadership in the country’s top seat. They said they would want a Ruto/Waiguru ticket in 2022. Pastor Titus Ngugi of Gatanga AIPCA told politicians from Mt Kenya region who have expressed interest in the country’s coveted seat to shelve their ambitions. Those who have expressed interest in the seat include senator Kithure Kindiki, Murang’a governor Mwangi Wairia and former Kiambu governor William Kabogo.
