Kiss FM presenter Chito Ndhlovu has for the first time opened up about his struggle with depression, saying it nearly drove him to kill himself. "There is a time I tried to take my own life three times. I tried three times, I successfully failed," Chito posted on social media. "I was so deeply depressed, I didn’t want to hear about God, I didn’t want to hear a verse, and it all didn’t make sense. At that point in my life, God felt far from me." Chito, who hosts the Maloko Show on Kiss FM, never thought he would get the job. "Something else that brought tears to my eyes is: I was called every every months for two years since 2014 by the programmes controller of Kiss FM to come and work for the organisation. Every time we were about to seal the deal, something stalled," he said. "I remember praying with my whole heart for God to open this door and it seemed far from me. The day my appointment letter was being printed, it was printed among over 100 termination letters. While I was getting a new job over 100 people had just lost a source of income. "Man can’t do that, God is the only one who can do such a thing. And here I am living that answered prayer, the thing I prayed is where I am. It gets my spirit excited like I am here for the time." Chito encouraged his fans, saying, “When you see me praising my God, it's because there is a place I have come from that no man can take credit for."
