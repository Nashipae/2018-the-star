Barely two months ago, Braine Lomoin lost his sister, Maribel Kapolon, the daughter of Githongo Law Courts senior resident magistrate Caroline Kemei in unclear circumstances. Although he was heartbroken, Braine put the bitter episode behind him and scored 428 marks in the KCPE examination. There was jubilation and celebration at their Eldoret home after the results were released. The magistrate told the Star on the phone on Tuesday she is so happy about her son's performance. "It was a very difficult time for Briane but God is great. He was able to pull through," Kemei said. Maribel, 9, went missing on September 6. It was alleged that she was kidnapped while heading home after being dropped by the school bus. Her body was later found dumped in Gitoro Forest in Imenti North on September 16. The body had cuts on the thighs, one arm appeared to have been burnt with acid and a part of the head had no hair. The top students in this year's exam are Rawlings Odhiambo and Olive Wachira who scored 453.
