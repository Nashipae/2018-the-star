A fisherman was on Saturday beaten to death at Sika beach in Siaya county for defiling his stepdaughter. Ben Onyango, 24, succumbed to head and chest injuries inflicted on him by John Odhiambo - a neighbour, during the 11pm incident. Witnesses said the two engaged in a verbal exchange before the fight turned physical leading to Ben's death. Area chief Ambrose Ogema said Ben has been staying with the girl's mother for three years. The murder suspect, who hails from Kisumu county, was rescued by the police after angry residents came out baying for his blood. Ogema said the suspect is being held at Mageta Island police post for further interrogation before being charged. The fisherman's body was taken to Bondo sub-county hospital mortuary. The administrator warned the locals against taking the law into their hands. He said: "If indeed he knew that Ben was sexually abusing his daughter, he should have reported the matter to us for action to be taken." Click here for the latest political news
