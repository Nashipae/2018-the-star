Over 2,500 former Karuturi flower farm workers have now invaded the property and subdivided it for farming activities. The workers have been demanding over Sh320 million as compensation and allowances following the farm's closure three years ago. Karuturi was put under receivership after it got into the red, a situation that exposed its workers to abject poverty. Samson Auda, the worker's representative, on Wednesday, said they had resolved to start tilling the farm for small-scale production. He said the farm closed shop completely a year ago after receiver managers left. He said most machines were sold or stolen. "As we await our fate, we will no longer allow ourselves to get hungry yet there is a farm we can till and find something to eat," he said. "We know the land is not ours but as we await what happens next, workers will put it into use and they are now free to start looking for seedlings to plant." Auda said many of the workers died due to depression after the farm was closed while others were bedridden due to life-threatening diseases. "Three of our members are critically ill and cannot afford proper medication," he said. The Court of Appeal will on December 20 make a ruling on a debt dispute pitting the farm owner Ram Karuturi and CFC Bank.
