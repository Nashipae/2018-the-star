The Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya has praised the US Judiciary’s handling of the Akasha case. The council said yesterday Kenyan courts should “watch and learn”. The CIPK said the move by the US government to seize and auction properties worth billions of shillings belonging to the Akashas was “fair”. Bakhtash and Ibrahim Akasha were arrested on November 9, 2014, in Kenya. The arrests were made through an undercover operation led by the US drug enforcement agency. The clerics said if the Kenyan Judiciary would take such steps, then drug cases would drastically decline and the economy will receive a much-needed boost. CIPK organising secretary Mohamed Khalifa said the Judiciary, the DPP, the DCI and the EACC should join hands and work together to fight corruption and drug peddling.
