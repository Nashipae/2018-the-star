Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny has urged the government to create storage space for maize before the NCPB starts buying this year’s harvest. He said Rift Valley MPs plan to meet President Uhuru Kneyatta and DP William Ruto to discuss the price announced by the Strategic Grain Reserves Board. The board said a 90kg bag would sell for Sh2,300. The Agriculture ministry has suspended the price and a team tasked to look into pricing. Farmers and North Rift governors had protested against the new figure. Kuttuny said on Sunday the cash is too little and wants it raised to Sh3,400. He said the Jubilee administration promised Sh3,500 during election campaigns. “We should not forget that maize farming regions overwhelmingly voted for this government. Fixing prices without their input or consideration on costs could jeopardise production,” Kuttuny said in Mwaita, Cherangany. He said farmers have incurred losses as their produce rots on the farm. The moisture content is low and farmers were not able to harvest on time because of delayed payments for last year’s supplies, he said. “I’ll move a motion in Parliament soon to enable our farmers to get free drying services at all NCPB silos,” the lawmaker said.
