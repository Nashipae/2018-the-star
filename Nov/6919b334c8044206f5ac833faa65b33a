Nairobi senator Johnson Sakaja (pictured) has criticised politicians opposed to a referendum, saying they are spreading lies. Sakaja ,who spoke in Kwale on Thursday, said the politicians are misleading Kenyans that the referendum is about creating powerful positions for political losers. “The referendum is one idea that came after the handshake. Implementing it will do away with corruption and ethnicity which are the devils against our prosperity as a nation,” Sakaja said. Sakaja, who is the chairman of the Senate committee on Labour and Social Welfare, spoke when he led the team in touring projects in Kwale. He was with Senator Issa Boy and Mohammed Faki (Mombasa). They said the aim of the referendum quest is to make the lives of Kenyans better. Among those opposed to the law change calls is Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori who has said he will only support a referendum if it will lead to Coast secession. .
