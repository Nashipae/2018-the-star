Diplomat-turned-musician Gilad Millo has confessed to struggling to quit smoking for three decades before finally succeeding. "I have smoked cigarettes for 32 years now and I quit. I never believed I could do it but I did,"  the Israeli-born Nairobi-based artiste told Adelle and Shaffie on Kiss FM. “I have stopped smoking for six months now. That’s like the biggest thing in my life." Gilad and Dela have teamed up for a second collabo titled Fire, where he expresses his dancing skills, unlike his other songs, which showcase his guitar playing skills and vocals. "I had to go for dancing lessons and even worked out for a few days to make sure our bodies would be fit for the dance. I have lost 25kg from that," he said. Gilad and Dela will travel to perform in Israel on Jamuhuri day, courtesy of the Kenyan Embassy.
