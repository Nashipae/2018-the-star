The Embu government will launch a cancer treatment unit by the end of this month. This follows the training of doctors and enhancement of equipment. Seven doctors at Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital did a 10-day training in Mombasa. Governor Martin Wambora said five special chairs have been bought. He spoke on Friday when he flagged off distribution of drugs worth Sh18.1 million bought from Meds Company. He was accompanied by his deputy and Health executive Jamleck Muturi. Special cabinets (hoods) worth Sh4 million have been bought for mixing cancer drugs. The hospital has received cancer and renal drugs worth Sh1.5 million. Wambora said the county has in the last two months distributed drugs for treating a number of diseases targeting level 1-5 hospitals worth Sh49.1 million. He said the county has prioritised health care. Drugs for patients with epilepsy and sunscreen for people living with albinism was also distributed. The opening of a cancer unit comes as cases rise. Tenri group of hospitals CEO Jim Njamiu said cancer has become a serious threat to the people of Embu county. He said many patients admitted in both public and private hospitals suffer from cancer-related complications and that this situation requires quick and concerted efforts. Njamiu called on the national and the county governments to equip hospitals with cancer treatment facilities. He said most hospitals have few specialists and equipment, forcing patients to go to facilities outside the county and country.
