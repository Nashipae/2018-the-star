Samurai edged Shujaa 21-14 to win the Safari Sevens crown at the RFUEA grounds yesterday. It was the second title by the visitors on Kenyan soil having also won it in 2015. The visitors looked sharp from kick-off and took the lead through skipper Braam Venter with Frank Lawrence converting to take a 7-0 lead. The home team, cheered on by the crowd, responded a minute later from the kick-off with Daniel Taabu slicing the Samurai defence to score and convert to level matters at 7-7. Kenya were now in the ascendancy and Johnstone Olindi showed the Samurai defence a clean pair of heels to touch down with Taabu converting for a 14-7 lead at half time. On resumption, Samurai camped in the Shujaa 22 and Lawrence was to score a well taken try following good work by Venter. Lawrence made no mistake with the conversion to tie the match at 14-14. Samurai then scored the winner minutes later with Venter touching down for a center post try with Lawrence converting to close out the match. Samurai had defeated Morans 15-7 in the first semi while Shujaa beat Spain 31-26 in sudden death. Kenya Sevens head coach Paul Murunga said there were positives to take from the tournament. “I believe the boys played well. There are a few areas we need to work on before we go to Dubai in the next two weeks and to have two Kenyan teams in the semis shows that we have the depth,” said Murunga. Samurai coach Nick Wakley was delighted with the result, saying: “Winning for a second time here feels good. It was a hard fought final and the boys showed their mental strength and character to come out winners.”
