Kenya Commercial Bank’s right attacker Phoscah Kasisi has been ruled out of this weekend’s Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) national play-offs at Moi Stadium Kasarani due to knee injury. Kasisi, who has been an integral player for the bankers in the past play-offs, will miss the annual event as the team seeks to challenge for the title. At the same time left, attacker Milgreen Lituva is a doubt for the three-day event that serves off from Saturday to December 3. Lituva is nursing a knee injury as well. Team coach David Kinga, who took charge of the team last September after head coach Vernon Khayinga was sacked for alleged misconduct, said he is not worried despite missing the services of the two players. He said he has a pool of players to choose from and there is no cause for alarm. “I haven’t named the final squad just yet and it’s too early to position the players now. The two are great players and we will miss their services though we have able replacements.” He added: “Kasisi has been ruled out while for Lituva it’s race against time but we will re-assess the situation by Friday.” Asked about how he feels about being in charge of the team for the first time in the play-offs, Kinga said he is up to the challenge. “It’s volleyball right? Nothing changes. The only difference is that I will be on the touch-line— something I have mastered. They are the same players we have been fielding before and I really look forward to the challenge,” he said. He continued: “We are the title sponsor of the event and we want to give a good account of ourselves . The players are in good form and ready to challenge for the title.” The banker start their title campaign against Kenya Prisons on Saturday before facing Kenya Pipeline on Sunday and winding up the event against newcomers Bungoma County on Monday.
