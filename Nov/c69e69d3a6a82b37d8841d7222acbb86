Interior PS Karanja Kibicho has denied the Kenya Police and Administration Police have been merged as announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta in September. In an affidavit, Kibicho says the Kenya Police and AP remain “independent constituent services of the umbrella National Police service.” He says what the Inspector General did, as mandated by the Constitution, was to re-distribute the officers in the service by introducing a system command and control consistent with the constitutional provisions and enabling law. “The National Police Service Act mandates the Inspector General, to among others, to determine distribution and deployment of officers, organise the service into various formations, units and components and recommend establishment, management and maintenance of police training institutions and centres,” his affidavit read in part. But Activist Okiya Omtatah, who filed the case in September challenging the policy reforms, maintains the Kenya Police and AP are being merged for self-serving reasons. He further argues the change in the structure and command of the National Police Service is unconstitutional. Omtatah wants the court to determine the constitutionality and validity of the policy creating a new police structure, which merges the two units and crowns by abolishing their distinct uniforms and issuing them with the same uniform.
