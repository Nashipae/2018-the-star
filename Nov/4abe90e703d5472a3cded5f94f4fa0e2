The Michuki rules for matatus are being re-imposed by Interior CS Fred Matiangi. Speed governors are essential as matatus often over-speed. Insisting on seat belts for all passengers makes sense as this will reduce the death rate in serious accidents. Having ID and photos of the driver and conductor will make the matatu industry more accountable. But do we really need to stop matatus being painted in their current lively fashion? Public Service Vehicles are highly decorated in countries like India, the Philippines and Mexico. The PSVs enhance local culture and become a tourist attraction in their own right. And matatu owners and drivers decorate their vehicles because they are proud of them. That's positive. Matiangi wants matatus to be clearly identified with a yellow middle line. Let's compromise. Allow matatus to continue spending good money on their automobile artwork on condition that it contains the official yellow middle line. In 2014 the government wanted to standardise the appearance of all matatus but President Kenyatta wisely stepped in and said that he thought that it did not do any harm to decorate matatus. Let Uhuru intervene again to save Kenya's vibrant matatu art.  Quote of the day: "You can't really be strong until you see a funny side to things."
