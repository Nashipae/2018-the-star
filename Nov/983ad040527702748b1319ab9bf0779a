The family of freedom fighter Dedan Kimathi is protesting the withdrawal of security details assigned to his widow Eloise Mukami without notice. Evelyn Kimathi on Wednesday said Mukami's bodyguards Njabini, Nyandarua county and Nairobi were withdrawn. "Removing all her security details in Njabini and a bodyguard in Nairobi that Kibaki gave and left intact, will not deter her spiritual journey." "It will only make it smooth knowing that it is only God who gives protection," Evelyn posted on her Facebook page.

Two of Mukami’s other aides were withdrawn a week ago. "We are wondering what wrong we have committed to warrant this." Kimathi's widow was offered security and two vehicles by the government during former president Mwai Kibaki’s tenure. A permanent home was also built for her in Kinangop. Evelyne said the new development shocked the family. She said Mukami is now stressed, especially ahead of the freedom fighters meeting at her residence over the weekend. Over 400 freedom fighters are set to meet at her Kinangop home in Nyandarua. "We fear for our mother who is ailing as she cannot be rushed to hospital in case of an emergency," she said. Evelyne said that Njabini Administration Police commandant had told her the security was withdrawn as there is nothing much to guard at the home. Nyandarua county commissioner Boaz Cherutich denied that Mukami’s security at home was withdrawn. "I checked with the officer in charge of the AP and they have not been withdrawn. Maybe it is some misinformation," he told the Star on the phone. Related: Find Kimathi’s grave for hero’s burial – Family
