Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has assured speedy investigations into genuine cases of extrajudicial killings. He said the ministry is establishing a tracking database for the cases to ensure they are expedited. The CS made the remarks during a law and governance stakeholders meeting in Nairobi on Friday. "The database to be built by the Internal Affairs Unit will help us know the number of cases reported, investigated, and acted on." "That is what will ensure the credibility of the cases," Matiang'i said, adding that he would also follow up on issues raised by IPOA on the same. "We want no more of the silly games of file has disappeared or an officer has been transferred." The Cabinet Secretary said police officers who are protecting their rogue counterparts who commit crime will be punished as well. Matiangi asked Kenyans to stop the blatant condemnation of police 'as that is also hurting the good work they do to provide security." He said that nobody ever talks about the civilian brutality towards police, including those killed by criminals. The CS said nine out of some 13 complaints he received from members of the public revealed that police officers were also killed in the incidents. Matiang'i spoke at the height of concerns by rights activists who have protested rampant police killings in the country. Early this month, human rights organisations protested the police killing of 24 people at Dandora, Kayole, Mathare and Majengo in three weeks.
