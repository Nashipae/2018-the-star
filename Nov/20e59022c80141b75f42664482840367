Migori governor Okoth Obado has been arrested. Obado was arrested in a Nairobi hotel and moved to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters for interrogation. He was arrested after attending a meeting with Kenya's development partners. The meeting was also attended by Deputy President William Ruto and several governors. The Wednesday arrest came a day after EACC detectives found eight guns during a raid at his homes in Nairobi and Migori. The DCI earlier said the weapons would be subjected to ballistic examination and verification. The probe is to establish whether the guns were licensed to be owned by the governor. During the raid at the governor's residences, detectives also found crucial documents linked to a corruption case. The anti-corruption commission is investigating the loss of Sh2.5 billion at the Migori county government. Obado, who is also facing a murder charge, is accused of embezzling the said county funds through his proxies.
