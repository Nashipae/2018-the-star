The launch of Huddah Cosmetics was driven by passion, founder Huddah Monroe has said. The brand has been selected as the first social commerce merchant on Mula. “I am excited to be the first Hustle-preneur to work with Cellulant and Facebook.” Mula Shops integrate augmented reality into Facebook Messenger and customers are able to try products before they buy them. Cellulant’s Chief Product Officer Faizal Mirza said, “No matter how you look at the future of innovation in Africa- the future is in providing a seamless experience in a space that is currently fragmented. “This partnership with Facebook allows us to do so for a segment that is often neglected when considering the economies of scale in Africa. This is the beginning of our journey to offering seamless, smart and connected digital payment experience to our customers across Africa.”
