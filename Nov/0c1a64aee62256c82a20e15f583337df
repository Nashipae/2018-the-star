The UK will be poorer economically under any form of Brexit, compared with staying in the EU, new government analysis suggests. Official figures say the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under Theresa May's Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU. But a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit, the new estimates say. The prime minister said her deal was the best one available for jobs and the economy. "Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit," Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions. The government's Brexit deal faces a potentially difficult vote in the House of Commons on 11 December. Before that Mrs May is touring the country to promote the deal and was due to be in Scotland on Wednesday afternoon. Click here for the latest political news
