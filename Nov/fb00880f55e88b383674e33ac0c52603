Caf Confederations Cup debutants Kariobangi Sharks received a major boost after their first choice goalkeeper John Oyemba and holding midfielder Sven Yidah resumed training after being sidelined for the better part of last season, owing to injuries. The two, who have international caps, are regular starters at the William Muluya-coached club and have been confirmed to have recovered from back and knee injuries respectively. Oyemba, who was voted the 2017 best shot stopper by the Sports Journalists Association of Kenya (SJAK), suffered a back injury against Posta Rangers in June and has since not featured for his side. During his long layoff, Muluya surprisingly rotated the budding duo of Gad Matthew and Brian Bwire with the latter being preferred regularly ahead of the former. The youthful coach despite being aware of Oyembaâ€™s long absence declined to shop for an experienced replacement in the June transfer period and in turn insisted on handing the Bwire and Matthew the platform to showcase their talents. The aftermath has seen Bwire earn three national team call ups for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Ghana and the Ethiopian double. He also made it to the national U-23 Emerging Stars, who have been summoned for the Africa U-23 qualifiers. At the same time, Muluya will be glad to have Yidah back to the team after recovering from a knee injury sustained in training. In his absence, Shapan Oyugi and Fidel Oringa have been providing cover to his defence line.
