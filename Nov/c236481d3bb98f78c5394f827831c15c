A section of Homa Bay MCAs on Wednesday attacked a court messenger who had gone to serve the assembly clerk Daniel Kaudo with a contempt order. The messenger Elvis Ochieng’ had been sent from Kisumu High Court to serve the Clerk for allegedly allowing swearing in of Gwassi North MCA Evans Marieba as an acting speaker against a court order. However, MCAs who were still around the county assembly clerk offices pounced on him with kicks and blows. The MCA accused the court of meddling in the running of the assembly. “We’ve to deal with you because you’re the people who don’t want Homa Bay county assembly to progress in its business,” an MCA shouted as they roughed up Ochieng. Ochieng, after the assault, ran to Homa Bay Police Station and sought refuge before he recorded statement. “I was serving a court order but the MCAs assaulted me. The order required the clerk to show cause why the swearing-in Marieba took place,” Ochieng’ said. Homa BayCounty Assembly has had wrangles since ousted former majority leader Richard Ogindo.
