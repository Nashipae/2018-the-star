Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy after spending eight years on death row, has been freed from prison. Last week's Supreme Court ruling sparked violent protests from Islamists and the government agreed to their demand to stop her leaving Pakistan. News of her release led to some confusion, with reports she had been taken to another country. But the foreign office later said she was still in Pakistan. The case is highly sensitive and Information Minister Fawad Hussein said journalists had been "extremely irresponsible" in reporting she had left the country without official confirmation. Those reports were based on comments from her lawyer, Saiful Malook, who is seeking asylum in the Netherlands after facing death threats. Asia Bibi's husband had said they were in danger and pleaded for asylum. A number of Western countries are understood to have held discussions with Asia Bibi's family about granting them asylum. The mother-of-five was released from prison in the city of Multan on Wednesday and it remains unclear exactly where she is. Also known as Asia Noreen, she was convicted in 2010 of insulting the Prophet Muhammad during a row with neighbours. The Pakistani government has said it will start legal proceedings to prevent her going abroad after agreeing the measure to end the violent protests.
