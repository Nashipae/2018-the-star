A witness in a case who was jailed for lying under oath, died mysteriously on Tuesday just a week after leaving prison. Franklin Njeru was serving a six-month jail term for lying in a case where he was a defence witness. His friend Douglas Kinyua, said the man in his mid-40s, was a trader in Kubukubu area, Embu county. He was released from prison after his friends raised Sh3,000 to bail him out. "He was frail and complained that he was unwell when he came out," Kinyua said. He died at the Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital where he had been admitted. His home is in Marima village in nearby Tharaka Nithi Nithi county.
