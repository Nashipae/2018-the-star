A mother and her two-year-old child have been hospitalised at Marani Subcounty Hospital in Kisii following an attack by her husband last Thursday. The mother claimed her husband, Ronald Atambo, had disowned her four children born out of wedlock. She said her husband had denied all her children food, except a 10-month-old whom he sired. The woman said her husband ordered her to strip and tie her two-year-old to a tree behind the house using a mosquito net. She said her husband forbade her from using soap he bought to clean the child's soiled clothes. The man became more violent when he went home and found his favourite child crying and unattended to as the mother had gone to a neighbour to look for work as a casual labourer. It was then that he assaulted his wife, inflicting injuries on her face and eye. The Kisii county disaster management and rescue team went to the woman's aid and rushed her to hospital. The husband fled. The woman later reported the matter at Nyakongo police station. Head of county fire Brigade David Omariba urged residents to report cases of abuse. Chief Evans Onchiri echoed similar sentiments. Click here for the latest political news
