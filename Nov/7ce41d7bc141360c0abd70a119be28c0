Pope Francis has appointed Homa Bay bishop Philip Anyolo as the new archbishop of Kisumu. The news of Anyolo’s appointment was published in L’Osservatore Romano in Rome yesterday. L’Osservatore Romano is the daily newspaper of the Vatican City State which reports on the activities of the Catholic Church. Anyolo, who is also the chairman of the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops, will take over from Zacchaeus Okoth who is set to retire. “The Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops has already been notified of the appointment,” Charles Balvo said in a statement. Balvo is the outgoing Apostolic Nuncio to Kenya and South Sudan. Okoth has served as the archbishop of Kisumu since May 21, 1990. The appointment of his replacement was announced a day after he celebrated 50 years in priesthood. Anyolo was born on May 18, 1956 in Tongaren, Bungoma county. He was ordained priest for the Catholic Diocese of Eldoret in 1983. Pope John Paul II appointed him bishop of Kericho on December 6, 1995, and was consecrated as bishop of Kericho on February 3, 1996. On February 20, 2002, Pope John appointed him as Apostolic Administrator of Homa Bay upon the resignation of bishop Linus Okwach. He was appointed bishop of Homa Bay on March 22, 2003, and installed on May 23, 2003. He was elected chairman of KCCB in October 2013 and is currently serving his second term.
