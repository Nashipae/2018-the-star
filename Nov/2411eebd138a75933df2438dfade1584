A fisherman has drowned in Lake Victoria after tripping from his boat on Thursday. Kevin Ondiek, 37, was with two colleagues when the tragedy happened. Bulemia assistant chief Mary Were said William Okello and Alex Mulago dived into the water but were unable to rescue their drowning colleague. “They were forced to return to the beach to alert officials of the management unit of the tragedy,” Were said. The fishermen were from Rudacho beach in Budalang’i, Busia. Ondiek’s body is yet to be retrieved. Volunteer divers have mounted a search. Beach management unit chairman Sylvanus Ngeri asked the county to buy emergency boats to help during such incidents. Ondiek’s widow said she had pleaded with her husband not to go fishing on that day because he had been sick for time. Click here for the latest political news
