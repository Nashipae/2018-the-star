Kuria East MP Maisori Marwa has termed calls to reduce number of constituencies ridiculous and a waste of time. Proponents of a referendum have said reducing the number of constituencies, wards and counties will bring down the wage bill. Marwa on Saturday said they have not considered the marginalisation experienced before the adoption of the Constitution in 2010. The Constitution created an additional 80 constituencies and the 47 counties. New wards were also created. Ndia MP George Kariuki is among those who have proposed the reduction of constituencies. He also wants counties reduced from 47 to 12, saying running the regional governments have become impractical. Kariuki’s proposal got the backing of the Mt Kenya development caucus which said iyt’s necessary to bring down the wage bill. Marwa said the referendum should be about increasing representation and not reducing it. He said creation of constituencies was based on a factors including marginalisation and population density. “If those supporting the proposal are done with development in their areas, then they can donate their constituencies. For us, we still need tarmacked roads and other forms development,” Marwa said. He spoke at Lolgorian during an inspection tour of the upgrading of 75-km Isebania-Lolgorian road. Last month, Marakwet West MP William Kisang said Kenyans have the power to slash the bloated wage bill through a referendum. He was referring to a proposal by Soy MP Caleb Kositany that the Senate be abolished. Kositany also wants the positions of nominated MPs and MCAs scrapped. He denied the proposal was part of the supremacy wars between the Senate and the National Assembly. Click here for the latest political news
