A Malindi GK prison warder has been hospitalised after an alleged assault by his seniors on Friday night. Peter Ndirangu was reportedly hit with a pistol butt after he differed with two of his bosses. Speaking from his hospital bed, he told reporters that one of the officers who attacked had threatened him before. "The officer had told me he would kill me, cut my body to pieces, and put the remains in a sack," the warder said. Ndirangu is admitted to Malindi subcounty hospital with injuries in the head, legs, waist, back, and spinal cord. He could neither sit nor walk to the washrooms at the time journalists interviewed him at the facility. The officer said he was called to the mess by the two officers before the attack. "Since one had threatened me before, I declined to go to their table. It was then that one of them chased and hit me with a pistol butt." "I rushed to report the matter to the office but little did I know that they had called the police. I refused to board the police vehicle," he said. Ndirangu said the officer grabbed him in an attempt to force him into the police car, resulting in the injuries. The officer's wife pleaded with the authorities to transfer her husband to another hospital for specialised treatment. Coast regional Prison Commandant James Ngaira said they are investigating the cause of the fight. He said the officers involved will be punished even as other warders threatened to stage a go-slow over the attack. Click here for the latest political news
