At least five candidates sat their exams from hospitals after giving birth on day one of KCSE. Two students from Vinda and Ungatu Mixed secondary schools in lower eastern wrote the exams at Kitui referral hospital after giving birth on Monday. Another candidate from St.Antony Makiliva secondary school in Mbiuni, Mwala sat her papers at Mwala Level 4 hospital after safe delivery at the facility. Mwala Sub-County Director of Education Daniel Baraza Simiyu said the student delivered a baby boy. Two other candidates from Kaptimbor and Timboiwo secondary schools in Baringo also delivered at Karbanet hospital just hours before the exams. Nursing officer in-charge Rosina Kiptarus said the two gave birth normally on Sunday night. "We assigned them special rooms here at the county referral hospital to write their examinations comfortably,” Kiptarus said. Other students from Kasok Girls’ (Baringo North) and Pemwai Girls’ (Baringo Central) were also admitted in the same facility owing to health complications. Last Thursday, Education CS Amina Mohamed asked quality assurance and standards officers at the ministry to investigate the high cases of teen pregnancies. This was after nearly 30 KCPE candidates gave birth during the examinations across the country. While leading in the opening of KCSE exam storage containers in Mombasa, Amina said the government is developing a policy to curb the incidents.
