Good morning The ICC has accused the government of failing to extradite two lawyers and a journalist to face charges of witness interference The court said it is unable to charge lawyers Philip Bett and Paul Gicheru, and journalist Walter Barasa for obstructing justice when President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto were charged with crimes against humanity. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Tuesday morning.  Cash wars threaten to destroy Nasa A new vicious battle over the sharing of millions from political parties’ fund has split the Nasa coalition, spelling doom for the troubled Opposition. Each of the four NASA affiliate parties — ANC, ODM, Wiper and Ford Kenya — want a share of the money allocated from the Political Parties Fund and keep monthly contributions from their MPs. But in a hard tackle against partners staking a claim to the Political Parties Fund, ODM yesterday said it owes ‘no other party any money’. ____________________________________________________ We will not allow your greed and arrogance, revolutionary movement warns MPs Movement for Democratic Advancement yesterday criticised MP’s new push for more allowances, terming it as ‘selfish, arrogant and greedy’ and has no place in a democratic nation. In a press statement read by the chairman Okung Ndege during a press briefing in Metro Hotel, Nairobi, the socialist mass movement expressed its disappointment by the manner in which the culture of greed, entitlement and self-indulgence still maintains its firm grip on the Kenyan Parliament. ____________________________________________________ As hyacinth chokes L Victoria, more women trade sex for fish The spread of water hyacinth in Lake Victoria has shrunk fish supply to the point where fishmongers “can do anything” to get it. In Homa Bay, where women are reliant on men for supplies, that means trading sex for fish, an exchange locally called ‘Jaboya’. Water hyacinth is a free-floating perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical South America. With broad, thick glossy ovate leaves, it may rise above the surface of the water as much as one metre in height. At the moment, chunks of lake waters in Homa Bay Town and Karachuonyo are infested with hyacinth.  ____________________________________________________ Team Kuttuny to meet Uhuru over maize Rift Valley MPs have sought audience with President Uhuru Kenyatta over the maize crisis. Jubilee MPs Alfred Keter, Joshua Kuttuny and Sila Tiren want the President to personally intervene and have the government increase the maize prices to not less than Sh3,200 per bag. They say the National Cereals and Produce Board has been paying farmers that amount since last year. ____________________________________________________ CBK likely to retain base lending rate on inflation stability Central Bank is likely to maintain the current base lending rate at nine per cent during today’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Stanbic Bank regional economist Jibran Qureishi yesterday told the Star the regulator would likely hold the Central Bank rate due to a stable inflationary environment. "There have been no sustainable risks from the eight per cent VAT of petroleum products and food prices are relatively stable," he said. "I think the Central Bank will prefer to remain steady for now."  _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
