The Nairobi county government has ordered the demolition of a seven-storey building along Kayole Spine Rd. A photo of the 'visibly faulty' structure at Bee Centre, Umoja was widely shared on social media on Wednesday. The developer was ordered to demolish the block in an enforcement notice issued on November 9. The developer was also asked to submit the structural integrity report on the same within seven days. "You are hereby required to stop further construction immediately and submit architectural and structure plant," the notice reads. The notice elapsed on Wednesday, November 16. A demolition drive targetting such buildings and those put up on riparian lands has stopped for lack of cash. High-end buildings among them Airgate Centre (Taj Mall) in Embakasi, South End Mall on Langata Road, Ukay Centre and part of Oshwal Centre in Westlands, were pulled down. Walls of several residential apartments were demolished in Kileleshwa. Read: Demolitions stall for lack of cash Click here for the latest political news
