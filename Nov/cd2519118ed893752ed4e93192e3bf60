Siaya MCA Leonard Oriaro has accused governor Cornel Rasanga of plotting to kill him for  highlighting corruption in his administration. Rasanga dismissed Oriario’s claim as a fabrication. “That’s a figment of his imagination, perhaps he has a memory lapse,” the governor said in a text message to the Star. He declined to comment further on “unfounded allegations”. The Central Alego MCA said he was saddened to learn of the plot to eliminate him just because he differed with the governor over accountability. Addressing journalists in Siaya town on Sunday, Oriaro said since he was a human right defender and A good governance crusader, not even death threats will deter him. Oriaro said Rasanga called him during a training session in Mombasa on Wednesday. “The governor called me at around noon with a message that enough is enough and I should be prepared to painful fall,” Oriaro said. Siaya county communications director Jerry Ochieng said the allegations of a murder plot amount to a witch-hunt.
