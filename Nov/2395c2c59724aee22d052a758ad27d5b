Interior CS Fred Matiang’i yesterday dismissed statements by MPs that he does not respect Parliament. Matiang’i said he has attended at least 39 sessions with the National Assembly committee on national security and international relations in the past one year. “The Hansard will bear me witness. I have faithfully attended all meetings and where I’m held up in unavoidable State functions including Cabinet meetings, our Chief Administrative Secretary (Patrick Ntutu) attends,” he said. The CS also said he will write to Speaker Justin Muturi to show that he has attended meetings. “We are responsible public servants. I will address the Speaker and the Majority Leader to present the facts as they are,” he said. He said MPs should not intimidate or malign government officers especially where they cannot defend themselves. He said he keeps track of all the questions from Parliament.
