STEPHEN ASTARIKO/ Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamed Birik has said security has been reinforced in all the examination centres, especially on the the Somalia border, to prevent any disruption from al Shabaab. “We don’t anticipate or foresee any challenge and if it occurs, we are ready to deal with it. We have been meticulous in our planning and coordination between various agencies and ministries involved. It’s our hope and prayer that nothing will go wrong,” Birik said yesterday in Balambala. “We are ready to provide a conducive environment to the candidates and invigilators to ensure smooth running of the exercise,” he said. Birik said they would also transport exam materials to areas that have been experiencing heavy rains. “We have positioned aircraft to airlift exams in centres that might experience challenges because of the heavy rains,” Birik said. Last week, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i assured parents and candidates the exam will be “clean”. Matiangi, who spoke in Garissa town, warned those planning to engage in irregularities “will be dealt with ruthlessly”.
