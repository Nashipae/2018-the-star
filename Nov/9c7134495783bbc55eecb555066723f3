Automobile manufacturer Suzuki corporation has refuted claims that Suzuki Alto 800 used by Uber for its Chap Chap service is unsafe for use. This even as car rating website Euro Ncap revealed early this year that Suzuki Alto 800 failed the Standard Safety requirement that rated its crash protection ability. In an interview with the Star, Suzuki Middle East Africa general manager for Automobile Koichi Suzuki said they have made electronic stability control an option on all variants of the Alto besides fixing it with Airbags. Last week, the Japanese firm entered into into a memorandum of understanding with Uber that will see the digital taxi firm expand the fuel-efficient option across Sub Saharan Africa. The deal gives drivers who don’t own their own vehicle or drive someone else’s, and who may not qualify for traditional credit, the chance to own their own vehicle and start their business. Only drivers with ratings above 4.6 (out of 5) and those who have made Sh300,000 within the last previous three months qualify for a credit facility from Uber bank partner to acquire the car. At least 500 Suzuki Altos have been released in the market with a plan to double the number before February when the deal was introduced. Last month , Estonian based ride sharing platform Taxify also unveiled a similar deal with Simba Corporation to use the Renault Kwid for drivers on its platform.
