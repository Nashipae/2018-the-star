West Pokot governor John Lonyangapouo's security detail has been withdrawn. The officers were recalled following Wednesday's incident where the governor stormed a police roadblock to free a boda boda rider. The incident occurred at Chepararia on allegations that police, while enforcing Michuki rules, are harassing motorists. County commandant Mathews Kuto said the governor will not have police guarding his residence and office. He said police are investigating the roadblock incident. Makutano town was tense after residents learned of the developments on the governor's security. The residents led by Nominated MCA Elijah Kasheuseu said that are afraid Lonyangapuo might be arrested. He said there is no law that the governor violated in "protecting rights of innocent Kenyans who were being exploited by police officers." "The Michuki laws for boda boda operators have been extended for two months and the police have no authority to harass riders," he said. The county lawmaker called on Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to "respect elected leaders." "The governor was elected by the people and he has a right to protect the interests of his electorate," he said. Lonyangapuo, during the Wednesday altercation with police, threw away roadblock barriers mounted on the Kitale-Lodwar highway. He said the roadblocks are illegal and blamed the police for using them to harass motorists.
