Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya on Saturday said he will win the 2022 presidential race with if Opposition chief Raila Odinga backs him. Oparanya said he was ready to deal with thieves stealing public funds in the civil service. He said he was keen on transforming governance to create a better future. “I know I will make it through for the top seat in 2022 with the support of my party leader Raila Odinga,” Oparanya said. He was speaking in Nyamira where he attended a church service at Nyabite in Township Ward. The governor was with the wife of his Nyamira counterpart Naomy Nyagarama, area Senator Okong’o Omogeni and a delegation of MCA’s from Kakamega. Oparanya said his aim for the Presidency is to unite Kenyans for development. “We have greedy leaders who are after public money. Those elected serve their own interests and not those of the public. That is not the kind of leadership we want,” Oparanya said He condemned corruption and tribalism which he said have destroyed the country. Oparanya urged leaders to unite to win the war on corruption. Click here for the latest political news
