Kenyans will register through an online portal for the government’s Sh1.3 trillion housing programme. Urban and Housing Development PS Charles Mwaura yesterday told the National Assembly Transport, Public Works and Housing committee that those who want to own houses will pay monthly contributions to support the ambitious project. President Uhuru Kenyatta will launch the portal on the eve of Jamhuri Day. The programme is part of the Big Four agenda. Others are food security, manufacturing and universal healthcare. The portal will connect prospective beneficiaries to the Housing Fund. “Members will provide information on their income and other personal data, after which they will be provided with an e-wallet account into which contributions will be deposited,” Mwaura told the David Pkosing-led House team. The project targets low and middle-income households. It seeks to unlock home ownership for Kenyans with a monthly income of between Sh15,000 and Sh100,000. “The low cost segment will involve individuals with a monthly income of Sh15,000 to Sh50,000, while the mortgage gap will be available for those with an income of between Sh50,000 to Sh100, 000,” he said.

About 10,000 houses will be built per month starting from Parklands to realise the dream. The units will range from one bedroom to three bedroom with varying sizes depending on the location and an individual’s or family’s needs analysis. A one-bedroom house within 30-square metres will cost Sh1 million, two-bedroom unit at 40 square metres will go for Sh2 million, while a three-bedroom house at 60 square metres will cost Sh3 million. Under the social housing unit category, a one-room house will sell for Sh600,000, two rooms at Sh1 million and a three-room house at Sh1.3 million. “The construction cost per square metre is expected to vary with the primary determining factor being construction methods. It will cost an average of Sh31,000 to construct a square metre, which is Sh14,000 less than the current cost of Sh45,000,” Mwaura said. The social housing concept has been borrowed from what is already being implemented in Kibera and Soweto A areas, where owners pay a monthly fee of Sh2500 for one room, Sh4,500 for two rooms and Sh6,500 for three rooms. The committee demanded to know the interest rates Kenyans will be required to pay. The PS said those under social housing will pay an interest rate of three per cent, those under the affordable housing segment seven per cent while those in the mortgage gap will pay an interest of 10 per cent.
