The families of three teenagers killed in cold blood by police in Utange on September 6 now claim their lives are in danger. They have reported threats after police said their kins were “dangerous criminals”. The three Masoud,17, Juma Kitsao,17, and Kenga Ramadhan, 18, were gunned down in what Muslims for Human Rights said was another case of extrajudicial killing. Flying squad officers allegedly committed the murder. Mombasa police commander Johnstone Ipara said the three were attacking and robbing people. "We recovered weapons from the suspects who were attacking people within the area," Ipara said then. But the parents have denied.

She disclosed that police “regretted” and “blamed” each other after the night shooting. “Some were questioning why they were killed. One asked, ‘How will we explain this?’,” Kitsao said. She said 13 police in civilian took part. “They said the boys will be accused of having knives and pangas,” she said at MUHURI’s legal aid clinic. MUHURI rapid response officer Francis Auma said the key witness has fled fearing for his life. Masoud’s mother, Majumaa Ngao said Utange village elder Mwangata Mwalumbi was assaulted when he questioned police motive before the shooting. “He saw the arrest and confronted the police. He knew the boys well,” she said. Mwalumbi said Masoud was a bodaboda rider while Kitsao and Ramadhan hawked clothes. Auma said it has been difficult to gather evidence for the case. “The community does n’t want to cooperate. No one is willing to record a statement. They think they will be the next target. One of the key witnesses has fled,” he said. Auma said IPOA has also experience frustration. “I’m appealing to Interior CS Fred Matiang’I and Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji to get to the bottom of this,” she said.
