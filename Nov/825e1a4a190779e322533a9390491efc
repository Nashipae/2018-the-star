With less than 24 hours before the 11th edition of the Africa women’s Cup of Nations in Ghana, national women’s team, Harambee Starlets’ participation in the event hangs in balance as they await feedback of an appeal lodged at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Football Kenya Federation (FKF) filed the appeal on Tuesday after the Confederation of African Football (Caf) reinstated Equatorial Guinea to the eight-nation tournament, having earlier disqualified them from the competition for fielding an ineligible player—Annette Jacky Messomo—during their final round qualifier match against Kenya. FKF communication officer, Barry Otieno, confirmed they had send an appeal to CAS and were waiting the outcome by close of business today. “It’s not true we send a letter to Caf to shelve the tournament. We are aware a lot of finances have been invested in the biannual event and therefore it will be unfair to do so on our part,” said the official. Otieno at the same time said the team which made their maiden appearance at the biannual event in 2016 in Cameroon and was set to depart to the host nation on Wednesday is still in the camp. “We are aware the event kicks off on Saturday (tomorrow) and we can’t depart to Ghana when we don’t know our fate. What if we leave for Ghana and find Equatorial Guinea, who have been drafted in the tournament by Caf? We need to know our fate before departing to Ghana lest we risk a ban. The good thing is that logistics are already in place but we must know our fate first,” observed Otieno. Kenya had been pitted against Zambia (November 18), South Africa (November 21) and holders Nigeria in the final preliminary match on November 24.
