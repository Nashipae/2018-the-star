Hundreds of buffaloes have drowned in a river on the border between Botswana and Namibia. Early investigations suggest the herd was being chased by lions and ran into the river, say Botswana authorities. A local lodge owner told the BBC that it looks like the buffaloes then got stuck because the bank on the other side of the river was too high and that they panicked and stampeded. He has never heard of such a large group of buffaloes drowning before. The authorities in Botswana estimate that roughly 400 buffaloes died. People living in the area collected the buffaloes and took them home to eat. The river flows through the Chobe National Park, a major tourist attraction known for its huge numbers of elephants, giraffe, sable and buffalo. Simone Micheletti, who owns a lodge on the Namibian side of the river, said that the herd was unusually large - at roughly 1,000 buffaloes. Click here for the latest political news
