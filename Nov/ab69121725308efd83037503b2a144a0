MPs from Western Kenya have vowed to support the gender Bill tomorrow. The Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2018, seeks to ensure Parliament complies with the crucial two-thirds gender principle. It will be tabled tomorrow by National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale. Speaking in Kakamega on Saturday, seven MPs and two senators from Kakamega and Bungoma said it was time to give women what belongs to them. They included Benard Shinali (Ikolomani), Malulu Injendi (Malava), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), Ben Washiali (Mumias East), Didmus Baraza (Kimilili), Mwamba Mabonga (Bumula), Godfrey Osotsi (nominated), senators Cleophas Malala (Kakamega) and Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi). Kimilili MP Didmus Baraza said: "When you empower a woman, you are empowering the community, but when you empower a man you are empowering an individual." Osotsi said this should be the last constitutional bill being passed in Parliament. "We have to go to a referendum and fix the loop halls in the constitution," Osotsi said. Devolution Cabinet Secretary  Eugene Wamalwa called on MPs  to support the Bill. He said: "Today, those of you who are in this Parliament have an opportunity to make history of passing that bill and redeem the image of Kenya in this region of East Africa and Africa as a whole." Senator Sakaja said he will list counties and ministries that have denied women contracts to do businesses. Click here for the latest political news
