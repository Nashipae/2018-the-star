President Uhuru Kenyatta will visit Homa Bay in early December. He is expected to present a Sh10 million cheque to Homa Bay Women's Sacco and inspect Huduma Mashinani projects. The President is also expected to present a water hyacinth harvesting machine, a patrol boat to beef security on Lake Victoria and life jackets to fishermen. On Thursday, a team headed by former Nairobi woman representative Rachel Shebesh held a meeting with the Homa Bay security team led by County Commissioner Irungu Macharia. Shebesh briefed Homa Bay deputy governor Hamilton Orata on the President's visit. During his visit, Uhuru will meet fishermen who have complained of persistent harassment by Ugandan security forces. He will also inspect Homa Bay Pier market and fish cooling plant, which was constructed by Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga using the National Government Affirmative Action Fund.
