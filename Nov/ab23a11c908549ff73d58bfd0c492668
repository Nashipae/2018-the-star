Sub-county commissioner Abdihakim Jubat said the 18-year-old candidate was admitted to Habaswein General hospital. A medical report on the incident indicated there was penetration. The case was reported amid concerns over the rising number of teen pregnancies. Education CS Amina Mohamed on Thursday said the country is facing a crisis "if this is an all-year-round phenomenon." Nearly 30 KCPE candidates gave birth during the examination period. Amina has also ordered for investigations into the rising cases of pregnancies among school girls.
