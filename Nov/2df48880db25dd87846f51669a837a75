Kericho police have arrested 150 people in their weeklong crackdown on traffic offenders. They include 100 bada boda riders and 50 drivers. They have also seized 10 private cars. The offences include operating without helmets, reflectors, insurance cover, and safety belts, flouting rules and risking the lives of other road users. Those arrested were charged and fined. County commander James Mugera said they will not relent on their work. Last month, at least 47 passengers died in the county at Fort Ternan where a driver lost control and their bus rolled. On Friday evening, plainclothes police officers clashed with boda boda riders who mistook them for their rivals. The riders had no reflectors, helmets and insurance cover. They overpowered the officers, who swiftly called for reinforcements. The riders fled and their motorcycles were confiscated. Click here for the latest political news
