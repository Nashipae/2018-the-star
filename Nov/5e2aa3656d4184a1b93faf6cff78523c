Mombasa matatus have lost Sh42 million since the enforcement of the ‘Michuki rules’ began on Monday, an official has said. Owners of public service vehicles withdrew their matatus from the roads for fear police would impound them. Yesterday was the third straight day the vehicles were kept off the roads as the crackdown of non-compliant matatus continues. Matatu Owners Association coordinator for Coast Salim Mbarak said operators in Kwale, Kilifi, Tana River, Taita Taveta and Lamu counties have lost Sh36 million. Mbarak said they were not happy with the withdrawal of vehicles from the roads because it hurt incomfor their drivers and conductors. “We are businessmen and we can never be happy about losing money. We also feel for our drivers and conductors who are struggling to put food on their table,” Mbarak told the Star in Mombasa yesterday. Mbarak said they support the enforcement of safety rules but did not like the high-handedness of Interior CS Fred Matiang’i. He said the matatu owners felt the pain of commuters who have been forced to either walk to their workplaces or pay hiked fares. Most commuters have resorted to tuk-tuks, boda bodas or private vehicles that take advantage of the withdrawal of matatus to charge exorbitant fares. “The whole mess was brought about by Matiang’i’s highhandedness . We are not against the ‘Michuki rules,” Mbarak said. He said the matatu owners were not on strike. “We have just withdrawn our vehicles from the road for fear of victimisation by police,” Mbarak said. He said they were ready to resume services if police stopped charging vehicle owners for mistakes of individual drivers and conductors. He said the matter was the main contention between matatu owners and the authorities. “It is unfair for a matatu owner to be charged because a driver did not put on his uniform or made a cheeky change of route to make a killing,” Mbarak said. He said vehicle owners should not be charged for petty offences like dirty seat belts.
