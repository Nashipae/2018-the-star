A student charged with examination malpractice was freed on bond yesterday. Abdirizak Hassan, 20, a Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam candidate at Ashabito Secondary School, Mandera North, denied the charge before resident magistrate Duncan Mtai. He was charged with having unauthorised exam material at a centre on November 14. Hassan was allegedly found with a mobile phone containing Biology Paper II data. The court dropped a second charge of being in possession of an electronic device in an exam room. Mtai said the second offence, according to Kenya National Examinations Council Act, was fatally defective. He said it is not an offence in the Knec Act for a candidate to have an electronic device in the exam room. “[It]...merely provides a good ground for the disqualification of a candidate from taking exams,” he said. He said the Act allows for cancellation of papers already done by a candidate or prohibiting the candidate from taking any future exams administered by Knec. Hassan was freed on Sh200,000 bond or Sh100,000 bail. The case will be mentioned on December 4.
