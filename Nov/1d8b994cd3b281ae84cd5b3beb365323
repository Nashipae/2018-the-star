Ibrahim Kibet stormed into the semi-finals of the ongoing Stars Senior Challenge tournament after beating Denzel Seetso 7-6 (4), 3-6 and 6-3 in the last eight at Nairobi Club yesterday. The burly Kibet, the reigning Kenya Open champion, was forced to dig deep for his win in the third set after the unrelenting youngster restored parity in the second set. Although Kibet admitted not have unleashed his best he lauded the budding opponent for the pushing him to the third set. “It was a tough match, he pushed me especially in the first two sets,” said Kibet. “I am elated with his aggressiveness and ability to capitalise on the mistakes I committed. I did not unleash my best just to give him morale and I believe he has learnt a lot and I am looking forward for him to keep on improving.” He added: “I am using this tournament to prepare for the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations and Karen Open and I am happy to see young players offering to challenge me. It shows that, as a tennis family, we are getting it right and I hope with such tournaments more stars will be nurtured.” Following the win, Kibet set a date with Petty Andanda, who recovered from a set down to floor Cameroonian Paul Wamba 1-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3. In another quarter-final match, Albert Njogu downed Derrick Ominde 6-4, 6-7 (12), 6-3 to qualify to the last four. Njogu said: “The match wouldn’t have stretched to the third set but I made mistakes in my returns in all sets. I wasn’t patient in my returns and hence ended up in making costly mistakes but I will rectify that before the next match.” Njogu will meet the winner between Ryan Randiek and Sammy Muriuki. In the girls category, Madagascan Narindra Ranaivo sailed to the semis following her 6-2, 6-0 win over Kenyan Tonia Kubai and she will play Alicia Owegi, who overpowered compatriot Gabriella Miheso 6-0, 6-0. Mialy Ranaivo beat Cynthia Cheruto 6-4, 6-2 to set a date with Shakira Varese who saw off Roselida Asumwa 7-5, 7-6 (2).
