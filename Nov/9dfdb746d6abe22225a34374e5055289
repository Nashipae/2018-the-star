After a one week tour of United Kingdom where they played one high profile friendly against Everton, Gor Mahia resumed training yesterday to prepare for the new season. Club CEO Lordvick Aduda said they need to hit the ground running in readiness for the Caf Champions League matches as well as the new season which will be kicking off in early December. “After consultation with the technical bench, we have decided that the team should resume training to start preparing for the tasks ahead. We have Caf matches and new season coming up in December and we better start preparing in good time,” Aduda told the official Gor Mahia website. The CEO added: “We are planning to meet Football Kenya Federation to discuss the issue of Super Cup match scheduled for December 2 against Kariobangi Sharks. We have the return leg of Caf Champions League match against Nyasa Big Bullets on the December 4 away in Malawi.” Commenting on the rumours that head coach Dylan Kerr was planning to ditch the club, Aduda clearly stated that the official communication is that the tactician is away seeking medication and will be coming back as soon as he is done with the medical process. “The official communication we have from the coach is that, he remained in UK to get some medical attention and he will be joining us as soon as he is done. He is in communication with his technical staff and the word is that, he should be joining the team probably by end of next week,” noted Aduda.
