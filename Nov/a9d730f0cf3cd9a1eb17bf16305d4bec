A manager at Equity Bank has been fired after interns accused him of sexual harassment through social media posts. public in Facebook posts last month. The bank in a statement said the manager made inappropriate advances at some female interns on the Equity Leaders Programme. “The Group has taken necessary measures in line with its policies and procedures, including disciplinary measures, and in some cases termination/separation of employment of certain staff,” said David Ansell, the group chairman designate. He said the affected persons, who presented their concerns, have been individually contacted and informed of the outcome of the process, and offered all necessary support. The company got wind of a discussion early last month that interns were having on their group’s Facebook pages. It entailed concerns related to sexual harassment and or assault by staff and fellow interns during their internship at the Bank and the Equity Group Foundation. The leadership team then convened a board governance committee meeting which resolved and created an institutional framework to address the concerns raised. “Thie structure was communicated to the interns through their group’s Facebook pages. They were invited to come forward with information so that their concerns could be addressed within the stipulated framework.” The news comes two weeks after Google revealed it has fired more than 48 workers including senior managers in the past two years over sexual misconduct. Last week, Google Staff worldwide staged a walkout  amid complaints of sexism, racism and unchecked executive power in their workplace.
