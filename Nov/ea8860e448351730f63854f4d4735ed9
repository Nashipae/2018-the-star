Rose Muhando has changed her name soon after making waves online with the viral exorcism video. Muhando opened up at a concert last Wednesday with Kamba musician Stephen Kasolo, who told the crowd: “Rose Muhando has now changed her name to Simba wa Kike (Lioness).” Rose explained why she has changed her name. “I have gone through a lot. The hardships have given me a chance to build endurance, hence the reason you can call me Lioness.” Adding: “My job is to hunt. I’m not scared of anything. When I roar, hell knows that sh*t just hit the fan. We will not keep calm till God receives all the glory.” Rose and Kasolo have a song together called Hautasumbuka Tena. Rose said Kasolo has "hooked me up with influential people who have helped me”.
