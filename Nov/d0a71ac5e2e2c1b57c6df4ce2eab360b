The National Police Service has dismissed a report linking its officers to sexual abuse during the 2017 general election. The service on its Twitter on Wednesday said it is unfair for the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights to link security officers the majority of rape cases that were reported. KNCHR report indicated that police committed most of the sexual violence during the elections. "We reject in totality the assertions made by KNHRC and appeal to anyone who was sexually assaulted by any Police Officer to report to the Police civilian oversight body IPOA for further investigations that may lead to prosecution and secure convictions,”  NPS tweeted. Out of the 201 sexual violence cases reported in nine counties, the report stated 54 per cent were committed by police while another 45 per cent by civilians. Gang rape accounted for about 52 per cent of reported sexual violence. Women were the most affected at 96.6 per cent and 3.4 per cent men. Nairobi leads in the number of violence recorded with 90 cases brought forward followed by Kisumu with 40 cases.

The service is now calling for fairness on the part of the Commision while urging them to help the service deal with any form of impropriety by any Police Officer by providing information that is factual and specific to facilitate further action.
