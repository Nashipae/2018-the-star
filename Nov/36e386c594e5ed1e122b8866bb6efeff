Confusion has engulfed City Hall following the expiry of executive’s contracts, which has threatened to paralyse its operations. The assembly’s Budget and Appropriations committee said the executive held a vital role in key county decisions. This was after a member of the committee, Kayole South MCA Fredrick Okeyo, revealed that the executives’ contracts expired last week. Committee chairman Robert Mbatia yesterday said their major concern was the tenure of the Finance executive Allan Mugambi whose input in the Finance 
Bill could be challenged in court over legal issues. Acting county secretary Pauline Kahiga confirmed that Mugambi’s contract had been extended for a month and an announcement from Nairobi governor Mike Sonko on the extensions expected soon. Minority chief whip Peter Imwatok raised concern on the legality of the executives and their stay in office. However, Kahiga to the committee’s surprise, confirmed that all the executives had their contracts extended but not for the same period. The committee questioned whether the cabinet would perform effectively with its members having different contract periods. “Already we have a number of chief officers, two executives and other officials in office in acting capacities. How will the county operate under such circumstances?” Mbatia asked. Janet Ouko (Education), Charles Kerich (Lands) and Mohammed Dagane (Transport) were among the executives present during the committee hearing. The three confirmed being in possession of their extension letters. On Wednesday the county’s acting attorney David Aseko was at pains to explain the contracts’ renewal period. “I’m not in a position to tell you about contracts. It is important we leave everything to the appointing authority who is Sonko,” Aseko said.
