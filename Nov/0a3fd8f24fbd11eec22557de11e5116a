Security agencies are hunting down three al Shabaab operatives believed to be hiding in Mombasa and Kwale counties. Police said Abdalla Omar Masudi, Alloys Otieno alias Ismael John Otieno and John Muasya alias YahyaMuasya are armed and dangerous. Abdalla, a resident of Ndavaya, Kwale county, has been under the police radar for some time for involvement in terrorism and other criminal activities. Police carried out a raid at his home on November 12 and recovered an AK47 rifle and a magazine with 30 rounds of ammunition. The weapon is believed to have been used in the recently increased cases of robberies and assassinations within his home area. Abdalla is also reported to have been training al-Shabaab recruits in Kinango forest. Ismael and Yahya were last seen in Bombolulu, Mombasa in October. The two were earlier apprehended in Lamu in 2016 while travelling to Somalia but were released for lack of sufficient evidence. Police say the two are also armed and on the run. They are believed to be heading towards the vast Kenya-Somalia border in a bid to escape and join Al-Shabaab. Click here for the latest political news
