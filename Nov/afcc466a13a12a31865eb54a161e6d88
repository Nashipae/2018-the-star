A businessman was found murdered and his hands tied to the driver's seat of his car in Machakos on Thursday. It is suspected that Peter Mwangangi Mula, 53, was injected with a lethal substance. The trader's body had blood stains in the abdomen - signs it was pricked with a needle. Police are yet to establish the contents of the substance that was injected into Mwangangi's body. The officers, in a report, further said the trader was last seen drinking with friends at his bar in Kanyonyo market. The vehicle was found at Kwasuvu village, Masinga subcounty, by locals who reported to the area assistant chief. "The scene was visited by the OCS, DCIO, DAPC, and Crime Scene analysts from Embu and necessary action taken." Police further state that the businessman had been called by a friend "to help drive through a police roadblock". "He told his friends that the caller had requested for his driving licence to enable him to drive past a police roadblock at Kanyonyo." "He drove off his car from Kanyonyo and later at around 4pm, the car was seen parked by the roadside near Kasiangove with its hazard lights on," the police report reads. The report further states that the vehicle was later found abandoned on a feeder road, a few meters off the main road with its doors wide open. The body was taken to Matuu Mediance mortuary awaiting a postmortem and the vehicle towed to Masinga police station. The matter is under investigation. Click here for the latest political news
