Security officers in Mombasa are on high alert to deter crime and terrorism during the November-December school holiday. Thousands of holidaymakers are expected to flock to the beaches in Mombasa. Visitors are being encouraged to familiarise themselves with basic water safety precautions. Mombasa county commissioner Evans Achoki said the government is strengthening security of the public during the festive season. Achoki spoke in his office at Uhuru na Kazi building after chairing a county disaster response team. He said security checks at airports, ferry services, shopping malls and public beaches are being stepped up. Achoki said security patrols have been intensified at all tourist attraction sites and those planning to commit crimes will be severely punished. The administrator urged hotels to increase security to ensure the safety of their guests. He said many domestic tourists from Nairobi, Kisumu and Nakuru go to Mombasa at this time of the year. Achoki said beachgoers are encouraged to stop all water activities by sunset and keep in close contact with volunteer lifeguards. He said no children would be allowed near the beaches after dark for their own safety. The Kenya Maritime Authority will launch a safety campaign on rescue techniques.
