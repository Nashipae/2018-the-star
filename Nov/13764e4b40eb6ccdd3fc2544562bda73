The protracted leadership wrangles within the African Inland Church have finally come to an end after a court ruled that Bishop Silas Yego and two others are bona fide officials of the church. High Court judge Chacha Mwita in his ruling dismissed the case filed by an excommunicated member of the church, David Mbuvi, who had claimed to be the general overseer. Judge Mwita ruled that Yego and the two others have been recognized and registered by the Registrar of Societies. Retired President Daniel arap Moi is long-time a member of the church that has been having leadership wrangles for the past 10 years. According to court records, the leadership crisis began in 2007 when an election to appoint officials was conducted. Mbuvi then claimed that he was the one who won the said election and went ahead to take over the leadership of the church. This led to the church conducting another election in 2008 where the church faithful confirmed bishop Yego and the others as officials. Mbuvi and Yego have been embroiled in several court cases to have themselves declared as the true leaders of the church. Yego had gone to court to stop Mbuvi from interfering with activities of the church. All the cases filed in court were consolidated into one and the ruling delivered by the court. Mbuvi was excommunicated from the church along with several others by the Central Church Council of the AIC following its meeting held on the 21st and 22nd of March, 2007 at the AIC Ziwani.
