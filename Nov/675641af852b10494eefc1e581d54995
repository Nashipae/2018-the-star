The West Pokot government has launched a Sh22 million programme to revive cash crop farming to diversify farmers’ sources of income. Five crops - cotton, pyrethrum, coffee, sunflower, and sisal - will be grown. Residents have traditionally engaged in pastoralism. The county government distributed pyrethrum, coffee, greengrams and tea seedlings in April as part of the programme which targets 10,000 small-scale farmers in Tapach, Pokot South subcounty. Other areas where the cash crops are grown are Pser, Riwo, Batei, Chepareria, Lomut, Riwo, Kositet, Murupus and Mnagei. Governor John Lonyangapuo said  farmers’ income is expected to grow significantly in two to four years when the cotton and sisal plantations mature. He spoke yesterday in Murpus ,Pokot South subcounty. “I urge farmers to embrace sisal and cotton growing as most parts of the county have favourable climatic conditions for growing of the two cash crops and fetch good prices,” he said. Lonyangapuo said he will link the farmers to markets when the crops mature. IMPORTS He also said his government will link the farmers to established cooperative boards and help them get cash. “I’m optimistic that by the end of four years, the farmers will have established themselves and will be able to grow the crops on a large scale for export to international markets,” Lonyangapuo said. He  said the crops will help reduce overdependence on relief food. Tea and pyrethrum will be grown in highland areas, while cotton in lowlands. Rivatex Textile Industries managing director Thomas Kipkurgat   said the firm will offer attractive prices and extension services to cotton farmers. “We have been importing raw material from neighbouring countries like Uganda and Tanzania. This region has potential to produce over  seven million kilogrammes of cotton,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
