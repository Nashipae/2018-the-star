He said speeding and drunk driving are the main causes of accidents. Meja said 92 per cent of these accidents are caused by human error, with mechanical problems accounting for five per cent while environmental issues are to blame for three per cent of the time. The government has laid strict rules to curb accidents. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has said passengers who board matatus that are full will be arrested from Monday. He said owners of PSVs that get involved in accidents will also be arrested. They will be prosecuted together with their drivers, insurers and body builders — if the body of the car is found to be substandard. These are some of the tough new rules that will take effect from Monday across the country as the government moves to restore order in the chaotic public transport sector ruled by cartels and rogue operators.
