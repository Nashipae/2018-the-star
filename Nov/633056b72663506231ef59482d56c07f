Centum Investment has not yet pulled out of the deal to build a coal-fired plant in Lamu, Energy CS Charles Keter told a Senate Committee yesterday. Keter told the Energy Committee that Centum is shopping for a partial risk guarantor” (PRG). PRG, also known as political risk guarantees, is meant to cover private lenders and investors against risk of the government and its agencies in case they fail to perform their obligations vis-Ã -vis a private undertaking. "Centum has not pulled out but even if it pulls out of the investment, another one will come on board. Government no longer gives guarantees," he told the committee chaired by nominated senator Mary Senata. In 2014, the giant investment company entered into a consortium with Gulf Energy to win the tender to build the 1,000 megawatt plant. Keter said pricing of power is not as expensive as claimed by consumers, and challenged the public to try and compare costing in other neighbouring countries. "Our costs have been reflective and sustainable. People want free things which is not wrong but investors who are saying the cost of energy is high should approach my ministry and ask for the price they want but we must see that in reduction of pricing of commodities they produce," he said. He said it will cost taxpayers Sh67 billion to end contracts between State and Independent Power Producers. "The total cost of termination of the three thermal power stations, whose remaining periods are within the next five years and where the Power System and Energy Balance analysis results demonstrated that technically, they can safely decommissioned without negative impacts to the quality and security of supply of electricity nationally," he said. The three are Kipevu1 (60MW), Iberafrica 1 (56MW) and Tsavo Power Plant (74MW) standing at Sh9 billion. "It may not be economically viable to terminate the remaining thermal plants given the duration of the unexpired terms of the PPAs and the need to have them in the system," he said.
