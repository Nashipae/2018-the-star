Doha-based airliner Qatar Airways will start its maiden direct flights to Mombasa mid-next month, Qatar Embassy in Nairobi has said. In an exclusive interview with the Star, Qatar ambassador Jabr Al Dosari revealed that the daily flights to the coastal city will be launched between December 9 and 15. “We expect direct flights to ease and boost business interactions between these two countries and help the city exploit its potential as a key global tourist destination,’’ Dosari said. He said his country’s open door policy provides fertile environment for exchange programmes for governments and people across the world to improve their lives. The 2022 Soccer World Cup which to be held in Qatar presents a chance for Kenyan traders to supply agricultural and other products to Doha. Kenya’s Big Four agenda on the other hand offers investment opportunities for Qatar businesses. We must support these mutual ties,’’ Dosari said. In October, Qatar Airways announced plans for direct flights when President Uhuru Kenyatta met a delegation of senior Qatar government officials led by the country’s minister for Transport and Communication Jassim Bin Saif Al Sulati.
