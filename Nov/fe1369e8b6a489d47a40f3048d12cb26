Kisumu county assembly members want security intensified on the Kisumu-Nandi border. They were debating after George Bengo, the manager at Justice Effie Owuor’s farm was on Saturday hacked to death at the farm and the justice’s son injured in Muhoroni area within the county. The suspect has already been apprehended by police. The MCAs expressed concern over rising insecurity on the border over the past few months. Market Millimani MCA Seth Kanga on Wednesday afternoon said it was unfortunate that lives and property were being lost within the county. While debating a statement, the MCAs said land and boundary disputes were largely to blame for the insecurity at the border area. Muhoroni/Koru MCA Julius Genga said it was unfortunate that several deaths have been reported in the area due to such disputes. Genga asked the government to seek ways of ending the intermittent border row. “We want the issue of boundary disputes permanently resolved so that residents can live in harmony,” Genga said. He called for an overhaul of security agencies on the border. Majority Leader Kenneth Onyango asked the county government, national government and the National Lands Commission to conduct proper land demarcation on the border to prevent further disputes. Onyango said many cases of land encroachment have been witnessed in the sugar belts along the border. “We hope that proper mechanism will be put in place by our security agencies to ensure that we don’t witness more loss of lives along the border,” he said. However, the speaker of the day Victor Rodgers directed the assembly committee on Justice, Administration of law, good governance and security to look into the matter and give its report back within 21 days. He said the committee can invite the security apparatus within the county to address some of the concerns raised by members. “The majority leader should also get a statement from the executive on the same,” he added.
