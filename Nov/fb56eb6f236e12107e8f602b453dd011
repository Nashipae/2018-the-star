At least 15 police officers were arrested in Kwale on Wednesday after being found with Sh11,000 bribes solicited from motorists. The officers reportedly collected the bribes while manning a roadblock on the Likoni - Lunga Lunga highway. Kwale police boss David Kosgei said the police officers raised suspicion after claimed that there was no traffic incident on the said night. He said the OCPD suspected an anomaly and instructed the cops to surrender whatever they had. "We normally brief officers before we send them on duty and even after returning, we take them through a debrief on whatever case they reported." "Itâ€™s so unfortunate that we found them with cash yet they reported no case," Kosgei said. He said disciplinary action will be taken for the officers. He called on police officers to carry out their duties without expecting any monetary favours from motorists. "Police are on the lookout for both the officers and motorists who engage in corruption," the AP boss said adding that at least 1,113 traffic cases have been reported since the enforcement of Michuki rules began this month. "The situation is improving. Most motorists have adhered to the traffic rules. We are urging passengers to also adhere to these rules during and after the festive season."
