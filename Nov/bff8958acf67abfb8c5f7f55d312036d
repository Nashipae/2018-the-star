A sombre mood engulfed Kathonzweni village in Makueni county after a nine-year-old boy drowned in Kwa-Matinga dam on Friday. According to Makueni OCPD Bosita Omukolongolo, the boy had gone to fetch water with his elder brother, when the incident occurred. He is said to have left behind his elder brother, 15, drawing water from water taps connected to the dam to go and swim in the dam. “We believe the boy could have drowned because of the presence of his clothes on the banks of the dam,” Omukolongolo told the Star. He said police are being assisted by local divers to retrieve the body, believed to have stuck in the muddy waters. Patrick Kasika, who was fetching water where the boy was swimming, suspected he had drowned and reported the matter to the area chief.
