Three Siaya MCAs on Friday accused the county executive of delaying payments to small-scale business people. Siaya Township MCA Obiero Otare, Okoth Olasi of West Uyoma and Onyango Audi of South Gem accused the executive of colluding with cartels to deny local entrepreneurs their dues. The MCAs said they will ensure that all genuine traders who won tenders are paid for their services. “There is no way you can fail to pay a local businessman Sh300,000 for years and pay somebody else Sh10 million for supplying air,” Otare said during the launch of a hearse project in Alindi Gardens. They said this is unacceptable and urged wananchi to demand accountability from those tasked with managing their taxes. The leaders were responding to complaints from traders who said they have not been paid for years for services provided to the county. Siaya Development Group chairman Edward Ochieng said they have not been paid for four years for a Sh300,000 contract to supply tyres. He said most groups risk closing their businesses after making losses as a result of unpaid dues. Ochieng told traders to be cautious when dealing with the county government. He urged the MCAs to help them. The ward representatives said they will table an impeachment motion against the Agriculture executive for failed leadership over the management of Yala Swamp. American firm Dominion Farms Limited, which managed the swamp, quit under unclear circumstances. Governor Cornel Rasanga on Friday said the company did not inform his government of its decision to hand over the management of the swamp to another firm.
