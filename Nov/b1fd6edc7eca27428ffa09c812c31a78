Matatu owners say they have lost more than Sh4.2 billion since the crackdown on traffic disorder was launched to ensure compliance with ‘Michuki rules’ and curb road carnage. Matatu Owners Association chairman Simon Kimutai yesterday said some 28,000 of the more than 80,000 PSVs countrywide have yet to comply and have stayed away for fear of being impounded. “Some of the gadgets we are to install are not locally available and if you risk taking your vehicle to the road then it will be impounded,” he said.

He expressed concern over the manner in which the officers are carrying out the operation, accusing them of harassing and intimidating their crew instead of enforcing the law. IG Joseph Boinett said more than 40,000 passengers, drivers and touts have been arrested since Monday last week for flouting traffic laws. But Kimutai faulted the manner in which the arrests are being made. “This is not acceptable. Law enforcement officers need to enforce the law with a human face,” he said. “We’re not thugs. We do legitimate business. We don’t sell bhang. We don’t sell drugs. We provide services that facilitate economic growth.” Read: Stranded nation: Pain of losses and sweat in matatu crackdown More: Don't Make the Crackdown a New Venture to Extort - Kimutai Click here for the latest political news
