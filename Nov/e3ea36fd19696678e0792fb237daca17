Kenya Simbas began their World Cup qualifiers repechage on the wrong footing, going down 65-19 to Canada at the Stade Dalot in Marseille. The Canadians, ranked 23rd in the world, got down to business in the third minute when Gordie Marone kicked over a penalty for a 3-0 lead. The Canadians were however reduced to 14 men there after when Matt Heaton was sent to the sin bin for a dangerous tackle. However, the Canadians increased their tally when Marines scored a try and a conversion for a 10-0 lead. The Canadians were relentless and scored a second try courtesy of Brett Beaukeboom which was not converted to take their tally to 15-0 lead. Heaton returned from the sin bin to score an unconverted try and a 20-0 score. The Simbas finally settled and fullback Tony Onyango ghosted in between two defenders to land at the corner for an unconverted try and a 20-5 lead in favour of the Canadians. The Simbas grew in confidence and Leo Seje scored Kenyaâ€™s second try, converted by Sammy Oliech to reduce the deficit to 20-12. Canada responded through Theo Sauder with Marone slotting home the conversion for a 27-12 score at the interval. Kenya came out firing on all cylinders and were duly rewarded when lock George Nyambua barged over the line with Darwin Mukidza adding the conversion to reduce the gap to eight points. The Simbas hopes of a miraculous comeback were, however, dashed by the powerful Canadian forwards who dominated possession and territory for the reminder of the second half scoring tries through Tyler Ardon, Theo Sauder, Mike Sheppard and DTH van der Meter who scored a hattrick of tries to leave Kenya in a dangerous situation.
