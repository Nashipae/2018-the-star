The wife of former Kakamega DC Paul Yatich will finally be buried tomorrow. Loice Yatich was murdered in her Kiplombe estate house, Eldoret, on October 16. She was initially to be buried in Talai, Baringo, on October 24, but her sister got a barring court order. The court also advised Yatich to agree with his in-laws over burial arrangements to avoid protracted legal battles. They complied, prompting the court to lift the injunction. “We’ve concluded talks and burial arrangements are now complete. Both families settled the issues,” Yatich’s brother Julius said yesterday.
