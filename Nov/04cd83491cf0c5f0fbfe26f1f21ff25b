Kirinyaga MCAs have raised a red flag over projects undertaken by the Executive. They have called on the government to complete stalled projects before starting new ones. Addressing the press yesterday at the assembly hall, Budget committee chairman David Mathenge said residents have complained of lack of tangible development at ward level. He said MCAs were not involved in ensuring the Executive are put to task over implementation of projects in the county. Mathenge said a decline in revenue collection had contributed to the executive not completing stalled projects and urged Finance executive Moses Migwi to rise up to the task. “For the last three days we have held interactive meetings with executive members and their chief officers with an aim of understanding the overall progress of development projects and their implementation since they took over,” Mathenge said. Flanked by 33 MCAs, Mathenge said there was little improvement in revenue collection in the financial year 2017-2018 compared to the previous year. He said this led to the stalling of most projects especially in the health sector where some dispensaries started by former governor Joseph Ndathi have not been completed. “From the Finance executive’s report we have noted that in the 2017-2018 financial year, the county only collected Sh344 million against a target of Sh600 million leading to budget deficits which highly contributed to most projects not being completed at ward levels,” Mathenge said. He said the county was spending too much on recurrent expenditure.
