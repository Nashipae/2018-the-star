A Slovakia investor has signed an agreement with the Kiambu government to set up a fertiliser plant. The plant is expected to improve waste management and create jobs. Governor Ferdinand Waititu yesterday said the county government has set aside 20 acres, where Rokosan company of Rokohumin organic mineral fertilisers can start building the plant. “We will play our role giving the investor free land as an incentive to the investment,” he said. Waititu spoke at the county headquarters in Kiambu town during the signing of the MoU. The signing was witnessed by Slovak Ambassador FrantiÅ¡ek DlhopolÄek. The governor said the fertiliser will be cheaper and environmentally friendly. He said the project will especially help coffee farmers, who are waiting for fertiliser. Ambassador DlhopolÄek said the Slovakian government considers Kenya a strategic friendly partner and is country number one for development cooperation. “We are running schools, clinics and two programmes in agriculture — cashew nut and macadamia — here,” he said. The ambassador said they want to stress the social and economic factors of the programmes by cooperating with small-holder farmers to produce macadamia. Farmers will be paid immediately after delivery. “We would like to come to Kiambu as it is a suitable place for macadamia and each year, we will produce one million seedlings, which will be distributed to the farmers,” DlhopolÄek said. Rokosun managing director Stefan Szoke said the development agenda for the country is very similar to Slovakia’s goals of providing self-sufficiency in production of organic fertiliser and ensuring food security. In August, macadamia farmers from the Mount Kenya region complained about exploitation by cartels and politicians. They said macadamia farmers have been suffering since the crop was introduced in 1956. The state, they said, has continued to lose revenue from high taxes. They said they want to get the same treatment as miraa and cashew nut farmers, who have benefited from subsidised fertiliser. Click here got the latest political news
