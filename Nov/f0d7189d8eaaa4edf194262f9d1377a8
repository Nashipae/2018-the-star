Reinstated Homa Bay speaker Elizabeth Ayoo yesterday failed to work from her office after the room was sprayed with a chemical that choked her. Unknown people allegedly broke into the office, sprayed the chemical and broke the chairs. The speaker was last month impeached by MCAs before she was temporarily reinstated by a Kisumu court. She returned to find furniture taken away and locked in another room within the assembly premises. Ayoo then bought three plastic chairs and a table. The chairs were found broken yesterday. She opted to operate from her secretary’s office where there was a chair and a table. “I came to my office in the morning but found the property destroyed. What is worrying most is the chemical which cannot allow me to stay in the office,” Ayoo told reporters. Ayoo’s allies included assembly Chief Whip Richard Ogindo and Kanyamwa/Kosewe MCA Nicholas Owaka asked police to arrest those who broke into her office. “We don’t know them but police should take action,” Ogindo said. Owaka said the choking chemical should be probed because it could be poisonous.“We should know whether it is fatal or not,” Owaka said. Owaka asked MCAs to forget their differences and work together for development. He said persistent chaos might cost members reelection in 2022. “I call for reconciliation so that we can serve the electorate. Many of us might fail to be reelected because of these wrangles,” he said. After Ayoo’s impeachement, MCAs elected Gwassi North ward representative Evans Marieba to become acting speaker. Yesterday’s incident happened just two days after Marieba adjourned assembly sittings indefinitely over “security risks.” Click here for the latest political news
