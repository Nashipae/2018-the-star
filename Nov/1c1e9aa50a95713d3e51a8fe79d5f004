After heÂ recovered, he gave his fans a show they will not soon forget. "It's normal for celebrities and performers to encounter some challenging moments while on stage, and mine came through yesterday," he wrote on Instagram. "I slipped on stage but miraculously I wasn't hurt, I came back on stage and gave one of the most electrifying performance, #Kisumu you guys are AMAZING the Energy was insane."
