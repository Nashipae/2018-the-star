Kajiado Governor Joseph Ole Lenku has banned the sale of salty water in the county. He said the ban followed reports consumers have been forced to take salty
water amid an acute shortage of fresh water. The governor directed private borehole
owners and water merchants to desalinate the water before sale. "Vendors who fail tests of water purity will not be issued licences. They must put measures in place to ensure the water being sold
is clean and fresh." The county on Friday awarded proprietors of community water projects that were deemed reliable in
supplying water to their members. The new order could
push the prices of water in Kitengela and Kajiado towns higher considering
that salty water is cheaper. It could also put
the county water department on the spot because vendors could cut off supply
citing inability to buy the purification equipment. Lenku, in his statement, directed the county water CEC Florence Waiganjo to immediately hold
consultations with the relevant stakeholders on prices. "The
adherence to this order will also include a discussion on capping of
prices. We shall not allow exploitation of consumers by water merchants." "The
cost of fresh water should remain the same. We cannot trade with the health of
our people," the governor said. During the awards
ceremony, Entalala water project from Rombo and Ole Polos water project from
Kajiado West were declared the best managed. Click here for the latest political news
