There are claims flying around to the effect that a section of Jubilee politicians close to State House are scheming to revive the case against Deputy President William Ruto at the ICC in a bid to stop him from running for President in 2022. The claims, which surfaced last month, have received additional currency with one of the former witnesses in the case (see page 30) linking the sinister plot to critics of the DP. The attempt to reintroduce the ICC in the 2022 succession debate is choreographed to deflect attention from probing questions on the maize scandal that saw local farmers shortchanged by the NCPB for shadowy importers. For the record, on April 5, 2016, ICC judges by a majority terminated the case against Ruto and Joshua Sang. The Office of the Prosecutor did not and has never appealed that decision. The charges against President Uhuru Kenyatta were withdrawn due to insufficient evidence and the case closed unless and until the Prosecutor submits new evidence. The only live matter before the ICC is the case against Walter Baraza for alleged tampering with witnesses. Against this background and facts, it is curious that some political opportunists in Rift Valley are working overtime to drag the county back to ICC with propaganda designed to earn sympathy or manipulate public opinion. These spurious claims should be dismissed with the contempt they deserve.
