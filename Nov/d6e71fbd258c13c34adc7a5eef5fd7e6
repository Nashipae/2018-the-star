President Uhuru Kenyatta has accused Central region politicians of spending too much of their time on 2022 succession politics. He asked the leaders to focus on their core mandate to serve the citizens. Uhuru said he will give political direction to the Mt. Kenya region before retiring in 2022 but his focus now is to work for Kenyans. "Kenya did two elections in one year and people are tired with politics. What they want now is service delivery," Uhuru said. Speaking in Nyeri townÂ on Thursday, the President told off those thinking that his influence will have faded by 2022 that they will be in for a rude shock. He said he decided to have a truce with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga in March after realising the country was too divided over politics. He told residents that development cannot be realised when leaders are engaged in endless politics. "Seat down and come with a plan on how you want our coffee farmers to benefit. Let us focus on what will better our people's livelihoods instead of moving around politicking," said Uhuru. Uhuru also criticised KeNHA for their recent move to demolish stalls and markets without a notice to the people. During the tour, President Uhuru opened the over Sh347 million Karatina market and pledged to open the Othaya Hospital soon. "Soon we shall be back to open the Othaya Hospital which will be a big hospital in this region and will serve people in Mt. Kenya region," he said. Those present were Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga and his deputy Caroline Karugu, Nyeri senator Ephraim Maina, women representative Rahab Mukami, MPs Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), James Gichuhi (Tetu),Wambugu Ngunjiri (Nyeri town), Gichuki Mugambi (Othaya), Anthony Kiai (Mukurwe-ini) and members of the county assembly.
