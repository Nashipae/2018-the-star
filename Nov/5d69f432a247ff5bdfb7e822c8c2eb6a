Public health officials in Mandera county have declared 13 wells unsafe and contaminated. Only one well is operational. The officials said the shallow wells are likely to have been contaminated by surface runoff following heavy rain that has pounded the region over the past month. Mandera East subcounty public health officer Hussein Yussuf said residents are at high risk of contracting waterborne diseases. “We...have written to all hotel owners and done public sensitisation to prevent a repeat of 2016, when a cholera outbreak claimed lives in this region,” he said. Some 894 cholera cases were reported in Mandera East in April 2016 alone and 20 people died Yussuf said well owners have not put up water treatment tanks. He said the department has enough chlorine and water vendors have no excuse for selling untreated water to consumers. Yussuf said only three well owners have complied with hygiene rules, which include having a toilet and water treatment tanks. The department had given the well owners a one-week notice to comply with health standards. The deadline lapsed on Tuesday. Health campaign Water scarcity in Mandera has led to private individuals transporting water by donkey carts and water bowsers. Nema officer Fatuma Maalim said Mandera lacks a liquid waste treatment plant. She said waste is dumped into the environment and finds its way into the water table and into wells, boreholes and rivers. In 2016 the Kenya Red Cross Society carried out a door-to-door public health campaign. Some 391,941 residents were trained on hygiene practices, including hand washing. Patients admitted in health centres were given packages upon discharge that included soap, buckets and water treatment chemicals.
