The Public Service Commission has named former military intelligence officer Twalib Mbarak as the new EACC CEO. He will take over from outgoing boss Halakhe Waqo if his name is approved by Parliament. The anti-graft agency advertised the position on October 9. Mbarak was among 14 candidates who had been shortlisted for the position. He's currently the Security and Integrity Manager at KENGEN. Waqo took office in January 2013, when EACC replaced the now-defunct Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission. The post is a one-term non-renewable contract of six years. Qualifications for the post include a post-graduate degree, clearance certificates from KRA, DCI, Higher Education Loans Board, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Credit Reference Bureau. Others who had been shortlisted for the position are EACC deputy CEO Michael Mubea, former KDF operations spokesman Cyrus Oguna and current EACC director of investigations Abdi Mohamud. Others are former IPOA chief executive Joel Mabonga, assistant DPP James Warui and Reuben Chirchir, who was one of the joint secretaries to the tribunal that probed Supreme Court Justice Philip Tunoi. The rest were Murshid Mohamed, Sarah Kilemi, James Warui, Vincent Omari, Jillo Kasse, Chege Thenya, Joel Mabonga and Lucy Wanja.
