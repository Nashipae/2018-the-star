President Uhuru Kenyatta’s nominees to the Public Service Commission have vowed to make sure Kenya’s workforce reflects the face of the country. Appearing before the National Assembly Committee on Administration and National Security the seven nominees for members and vice-chair of PSC told the MPs that they will bring to an end ethnic hiring and promotions in all government agencies. The nominees also promised to check gender parity in the public service as provided for in the Constitution. The committee chaired by Kiambaa MP Paul Koinange yesterday vetted nominee for vice-chair Charity Seleina and six nominees for the position of members of PSC. The six were Joyce Nyabuti, Mary Mwiandi, Reuben Chirchir, Patrick Wamoto, Andrew Muriuki, Salma Ahmed and Joan Otieno. Last month, Stephen Kirogo took office as the chair of the PSC replacing Margaret Kobia who was appointed Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs. MPs Opondo Kaluma (Homabay Town), Didmus Barasa (Kimilili), Ahmed Kolosh (Wajir West), Makali Mulu (Kitui Central) and Tecla Chebet (Nandi Woman Representative) put the nominees to task on the tribal appointments that have characterised the country’s public service over the years. “There are some departments in this government in which you find a whole tribe including cleaners,” Kaluma said. He sought to know how small tribes like Rendile will be considered in future appointments to public service. Click here for the latest political news
