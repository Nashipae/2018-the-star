Gangs have re-emerged in Mombasa, as attacks worryingly increase. At least 10 people have been killed or critically injured in the last three weeks as police grapple with the resurgent crime. On Friday and Saturday nights, two criminal gangs in Likoni unleashed terror killing two. The two juvenile gangs, ‘Gaza’ and ‘Military’, are feuding after a member of the former was stabbed to death in Majengo Mapya area on Friday. On Saturday afternoon, after the deceased’s burial, Gaza launched a retaliatory attack, killing one local and slashing over five others in the head, back and hands. Doctors say the degree of injuries sustained are severe. One person, a Rwandan named Bitunguramye Theobare,32, succumbed. Police were deployed and shot dead one attacker, while two others sustained gun wounds and are in hospital. In Kisauni, another gang struck again in Junda ward, injuring two people on Friday evening. The two Simon Mazera and Juma Karisa, were walking home at around 8pm when they were accosted by three men in police regalia. “They introduced themselves as police officers and asked us to lie down. But we suspected them, took our chances and took off. Two of them swung their machetes and hit us,” said Mazera. Police say the Junda gang could be on a political mission as their motive remains unclear.
