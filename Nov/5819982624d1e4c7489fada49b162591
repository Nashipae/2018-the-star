Activists have accused the Garissa University College Council for interfering with the running of the institution. Speaking to the press at a Garissa hotel, civil society chairman Mohamed Khalif claimed the university council has been coercing management to sack local staff . He called them a minority at the institution. Mohamed and colleagues said the University Council was holding too many meetings and demanding more than Sh1 million allowances. He said instead of holding three meetings annually as required by law, has held five meetings and six more committee meetings. Khalif said the challenges the university is facing are unique because of the terror attack four years ago. The institution cannot afford huge allowances for council members, he said. He said the council chairman is arm-twisting the vice chancellor, instructing him to sack all local staff. “This is totally wrong since their percentage is too low, they are 3.3 per cent of the staff ,” he told journalists yesterday. The council chairperson Christopher Gakahu however told the star that he cannot discuss the university issues with the media, when asked to comment.
