Unruly boat operators will not be spared in the ongoing crackdown and reinforcement of traffic and safety regulations in Lamu. County commissioner Joseph Kanyiri yesterday said officers will arrest operators and passengers who fail to comply with safety regulations including having valid licences. Lamu has more than 5,000 boats plying the islands. Unlike many parts of Kenya where travelling and movement of people and goods is done by road, much of Lamuâ€™s transport consists of boat travel.
