A French firm that supplied KIEMS kits for last year’s elections wants a case in which it is accused of breaching procurement rules dismissed. OT Morpho which has since rebranded to IDEMIA yesterday said Bildad Kagai and Kanuri Limited have failed to show how their rights were violated in respect to the KIEMS kits tender. “The petition is incompetent and is tainted with illegalities in so far as the evidential material relied upon. It should be dismissed as the petitioners have not demonstrated how their fundamental rights have been violated,” Ot Morpho’s affidavit says. Kanuri Limited was a local associate of Gemalto SA. Gemalto, a French firm, was one of the bidders for KIEMS kits tender, but did not win the award because it “quoted a price of Sh5.2 billion against the available budget of Sh3.8 billion”. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission directly awarded the tender to French company Safran Identity and Security after cancelling the one that appeared headed to Gemalto SA. Safran Identity and OT Morpho now say Kagai and Kanuri have failed or ignored to exhaust other remedies available in accordance with the law.
