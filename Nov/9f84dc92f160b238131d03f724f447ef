The Jubilee Party Twitter account has been hacked. The hackers have been posting messages informing users on 'how to make money online', promising anÂ opportunity to make over $300 (Sh30,000) a day. "If you guys want to make $300+ a day sign up at Dailysurveys.co they pay $150 for taking the first survey and $20-$50 for each surveyafter," reads some of the tweets posted by the hackers. The hackers who seem to be posting a minute by minute update on the Jubilee's party twitter account posted their first tweet at around 1pm on Sunday. The hackers have also tweeted videos of themselves advertising the Dailysurveys.co showing how fast and easy one can make money through the survey. Some of the tweets have had over 30,000 replies. The hackers' location is yet to be established. Jubilee Party, which President Uhuru Kenyatta rode on in his second term bid, is yet to respond to the cyber attack.
