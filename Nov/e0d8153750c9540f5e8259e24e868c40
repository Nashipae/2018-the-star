Investors in the hospitality industry in western Kenya have been urged to increase investments in the region by taking advantage of improved political climate. Mohammed Hersi (pictured), chairman of Kenya Tourism Federation, encouraged investors to take advantage of political stability in the country as a result of the handshake to promote for domestic tourism in the region. “The handshake is the big deal for tourism and investors are now assured of good results in the next three years,” Hersi said. Hersi also urged the local industries in the sector to work closely with the county governments to market the destination. Hersi said the region has low tourist numbers and lacks information about changing tourism trends. “Let’s deal with stereotyping that affects this particular destination,” Hersi said. He was speaking during the Fourth Annual Conference for Western Kenya hoteliers held yesterday at Sunset Hotel in Kisumu.
