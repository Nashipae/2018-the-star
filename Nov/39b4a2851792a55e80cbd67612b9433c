Kisumu City Manager Doris
Ombara has said she has not been suspended as rumoured. She said she has a five-year contract. Rumour on social media has it she has been suspended but Ombara said on Thursday she has not received any letter. “As far as I am concerned,
there is no such thing. I have a
five-year contract, which I was duly given by the County Government of Kisumu on
August 28, 2015 to July 2020 and it is renewable based on my performance and
meeting set targets," she said. Ombara said she was
competitively recruited as city manager by the County Public Service
Board chaired by Nashon Oguya and employed by the county government. Addressing the media in her
office, the city manager said she is not working on an acting capacity. “I don’t know where the
issue of acting city manager comes from because you can’t act for a period of
five years and on a job that was advertised on three daily newspapers,” Ombara said. The city manager said she was erroneously hounded out
of the office for 18 months but successfully challenged the decision in court. “...the court saw the legitimacy of my contract and brought me back here as the
City Manager,” she said. Ombara said she has now served for three years, including the 18 months
she was away. The official said she should be
given time to work and not be distracted. She noted those peddling
lies that she has been suspended are out to mislead the
public
