A court in Malindi on Friday handed a Madrassa teacher life sentence for sodomising his 9-year-old mentally ill stepson. Malindi principal magistrate Silvia Wewa said the prosecution had proven its case emanating from the 2016 incident. She said the court was convinced that Omar Said Omar committed the heinous act against the minor more than once. Wewa said a medical report proved there was penetration, and that the minor had bruises on his genitalia. The magistrate said a probation report revealed that the accused had other cases of sodomy which were not reported. She said the sentence would act as an example to others who commit such injustices to minors. The magistrate hailed the boy's mother for standing out to defend the rights of her child to get justice. Rights activists led by Muslim for Human Rights (MUHURI) together with Sauti ya Wanawake celebrated upon hearing the judgment. "We thank the Mother who despite being a Muslim stood out to fight for the justice of her child," Helda Esily, chairperson Sauti ya Wanawake, said. Topister Juma, a MUHURI gender officer, said cases of sodomy are on the rise in Malindi. She castigated the members of the Muslim community for opting to solve the cases traditionally instead of going to court. Click here for the latest political news
