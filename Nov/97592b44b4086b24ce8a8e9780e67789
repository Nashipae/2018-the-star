 The skeleton of Karanja, the celebrity Maasai Mara’s oldest rhino whose trademark was a long pinsharp horn, evoked nostalgia to conservationists on Wednesday. Karanja’s skeleton was displayed at the National Museums of Kenya after the Narok county government donated its remains. Karanja was popular with tourists as he used to relax even when close to vehicles. The huge and strong animal, gifted with two horns that were particularly long, had become a darling of tourists who thronged the Maasai Mara. He was admired and photographed by generations of tourists.So popular was he that guides and tour operators nick-named him Karanja. Karanja’s popularity would however hit a dead end in December 2014 when the black rhino, aged 43, died on Christmas Day due to natural causes. Karanja’s longer horn weighed fi ve kilograms while the shorter one was three and a half kilograms. It is now under safe custody of Kenya Wildlife Service. Paolo Torchio and Magali Manconi however decided to help the museum to have the iconic skeleton displayed, something that became a reality on Wednesday. The mounting process, which was a collaboration between Italian embassy and the museum, took over three years. Italy ambassador Alberto Pierisaid Karanja was iconic and a legend. “The embassy and the Italian Institute of Culture heard about the news and supported its preservation,”he said. Pieri said that by sponsoring Karanja’s project, they contributed to the country’s wildlife conservation. The embassy provided Sh300,000 for mounting of the skeleton while promising to collaborate in other areas such as research. “Kenya has incredible natural heritage whose conservation success is not only on behalf of its people but also tourism and development,” he said. Head of Osteology Ogeto Mwebi said Karanja’s mounting was the second. They had mounted another animal from Lewa Conservancy. Click here for the latest political news
