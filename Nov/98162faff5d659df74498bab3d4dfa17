The Building Bridges Initiative Task Force yesterday urged politicians to stop politicising their mandate. Some leaders have called for a referendum to review the Constitution, while others have opposed it. Chairman Yusuf Haji (Garissa senator) said they are making progress in gathering Kenyans’ views on the nine-point agenda proposed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. He said they will only recommend a referendum if Kenyans demand it. The team is conducting public hearings. So far, it has been to Nairobi, Machakos, Makueni and Kitui. Yesterday, they headed to Meru, Tharaka Nithi and Embu. They also receive written memomranda. “If at the end of our public hearings Kenyans will propose issues that require a referendum to address, we’ll recommend so to the principals who appointed us. Kenyans are aware of what is ailing them and they are making proposals on how to resolve them,” Haji told the media in Nairobi. Vice chairman Adams Oloo said their work is cut out — to collect public views and compile a report proposing solutions to the problems the country faces after every election period. “We shall distil what Kenyans will tell us and make conclusions after hearing what they want. We’re a body that is collecting the views on the nine issues then we advise the principals on the way forward,” he said. “If it turns out the challenges requires referendum, we shall say so and if they need policy change, we shall also point out.” Uhuru and Raila formed the taskforce after their March 9 handshake deal that ended hostilities that emanated from last year’s election. Busia senator Amos Wako, a member of the task force, said they will come up with lasting solutions to fix the challenges the country has faced over the years.
