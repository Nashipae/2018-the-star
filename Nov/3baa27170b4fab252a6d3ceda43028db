Comedian Eric Omondi has confirmed that he is still in good terms with Citizen TV Jacque Maribe. Eric said their friendship is still very tight. "The question has been asked by so many people, but me and Jacque, we are good friends," Eric told Massawe on Radio Jambo. In 2015, the comedian admitted that he was in a relationship with Jacque Maribe but the two were no longer an item, and he had since moved on. He had always denied being in a relationship with the TV presenter and being the father of Jackie’s baby. The two had kissed passionately during Jacque’s birthday, and the photos showing the intimate moment leaked on social media. Eric further explained on Radio Jambo how the two met, saying it was in their line of duty. "I met Jacque Maribe when we were both employees at Radio Africa Group, and our friendship grew from there. We even went for a date at Sarit Centre and had some tea. Since then our friendship has been so tight," he said. "Till now we are still friends and every time we tell ourselves that whatever happens, we will still remain friends. I chat her on messages but I will not say if I visited her when she was incarcerated." Earlier on, State House operative Dennis Itumbi, who has also been romantically linked with the anchor, defended Eric Omondi for posting Jacque Maribe's son on social media, saying he (Eric) was only expressing his friendship by posting the picture. Asked if the two are friends, Eric said yes, but claimed to have forgotten where he was during Jacque's baby shower, which was held in Dennis Itumbi's house. Asked if he was passing a message when he posted a photo of Jacque's son on Instagram, Eric said: "When I posted the picture, I was in Dubai and when I came back, everyone wanted to know about it, but hilo ni swala nyeti sana," he said. "Hio swali ni ngumu (That question is tough)." Eric is currently dating an Italian girlfriend called Shantel.
