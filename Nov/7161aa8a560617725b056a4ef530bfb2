Parcels of land belonging to a public primary school and the Kenya Red Cross are among 60 plots grabbed by private developers in Kwale county. The National Land Commission has started investigations into how the land, among others, was grabbed along with that on which the county tourism office stands in the tourist resort town of Diani. According to the commissionâ€™s vice chairperson Abigail Mbagaya, petitions have been received on the controversial Diani Settlement Scheme where a private individual already has title deeds for the land occupied by the two government institutions, and the charitable organisation. Mbagaya was speaking during the start of a three day public hearing on unresolved land tenure issues in the county at the Kenya School of Government, Matuga.
