Celebrated Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s novel Matigari, is being adapted into a film by Nollywood director Kunle Afolayan. Kunle is a Nigerian actor, film producer and director. His work has received universal acclaim and was the first Nigerian film to be screened at the Pan African Film Festival in 2007. Commenting on the project, Afolayan said, “Ngugi is like the Wole Soyinka of Nigeria in Kenya and one of his books is going to be adapted into a film. It’s going to be a South Africa-Kenya-Nigeria co-production and I’m representing Nigeria.” He made the announcement on the sidelines of the African Movie Academy Awards (AMAA) that took place in Kigali, Rwanda. The film’s co-producers are yet to be disclosed. The novel, produced in 1987, is a moral and political tale in which the protagonist Matigari, a freedom fighter, emerges from the bush in the political dawn of post-Independence Kenya. He searches for his family and a new future but finds that not much has since changed. The book deals with various themes, including oppression, exploitation, inequality and betrayal. African storytelling in film and dance has gained global prominence in recent years, but more still needs to be done. There is lack of domestic investment in the film industry. The year 2018, in particular,  has been an exciting time for African storytelling in film production and in various other art forms. The global success of Black Panther motivated Africans to take pride in and seize the leading role in telling their own realities rather than waiting for foreigners to create and curate such important conversations. Adaptation projects announced this year include Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s novel Americanah and The Daily Show host Trevor Noah’s bestselling autobiography Born a Crime: Stories from a Southern African Childhood.
