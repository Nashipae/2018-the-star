Lamu women seeking to join the Kenya Defence Forces were disappointed yesterday after they were locked out for yet another year. Lt Col Paul Aruasa said they have enough women in the forces. Women were also locked out of last year’s recruitment on similar grounds. Aruasa however urged them not to give up. "We know it’s a disappointment. But I know things will change in future,” he said. The recruitment took place in the Kibaki grounds on Lamu Island and attracted 200 hopefuls. Applicants said KDF should have announced it was not recruiting women. Loice Kazungu, 23, said she has been turned away three times. "I am so frustrated. I have run on this pitch every single year for the last three years. I scored C plain in KCSE and I met all required standards of weight, height and general body well being,” she said. Susan Wangui, 35, is a graduate of the National Youth Service. She said she has failed to make the cut four times. "NYS graduates were to be given priority but that’s not been the case... What happened to gender balance? It’s not fair that only men get these opportunities and we don’t. It’s unfair," Wangui said. Immaculate Muthee, 21, said she had been tuned away a second time. "I am [angry] because we spent a whole year preparing then we are turned away without even being allowed to go through the process," she said. "Instead of waiting until the recruitment day to tell us that we are not needed,they should make it clear from the word go so that we don’t waste our time coming or hoping." Aruasa told hopefuls to keep their bodies "pure and natural". He said many candidates were dropped because they had discoloured teeth while some had tattoos.
