A reformed Mungiki sect member in Nyeri has been murdered and his body stashed in a sack, one month after he surrendered to police. John Githinji was reported missing on Sunday and his acid-burnt body recovered on Thursday morning. Githinji was taken to the Central Regional DCI headquarters in October by Muslims for Human Rights chairman Khelef Khalifa when the government started a fresh crackdown on Mukingi members. In 2000, he together with one Joseph Keng’ethe were sentenced to six years in prison for robbery with violence. "He had reformed after leaving prison in 2006 but due to the crackdown on the sect, he presented himself to police and was assured of his protection," Khalifa said. His body had wounds all over according to his wife Julia Wanjiku. “It's evident that no other Mungiki member will ever surrender to police. In a matter of a fact, the police are putting our lives in danger,” Khalifa said. The deceased had three kids. Click here for the latest political news
