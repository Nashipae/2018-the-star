There was drama at Runda police station when Meru senator Mithika Linturi's wife Maryanne Keitany served him with restraining orders. Milimani Commercial Court senior resident magistrate Isaac Orenge issued exclusive occupation of the coupleâ€™s shared residence to Keitany. Linturi has also been barred from contacting his wife after she accused him of threatening to shoot her. In the order dated October 25, 2018, Linturi will only be permitted to enter their residence accompanied by an enforcement officer to collect personal belongings. "That pending hearing and determination of this application an interim order of protection is, hereby, issued against the respondent and/or agent, employees and servants," read the court order. The senator is restrained from physically or sexually abusing or threatening the wife, her staff and their six children or person associated with her. Linturi is barred from damaging or threatening to damage any property belonging to Keitany. He is also not allowed to loiter near the home or areas the wife visits often. He can only contact her when permitted by the court. The ruling comes days after Keitany filed a complaint at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, claiming he threatened to kill her. Linturi admitted he was at the DCI, but denied reports that he recorded a statement over the allegations. "I have not been summoned to the DCI nor recorded any statement. If I am called upon, I will present myself there," he said. Click here for the latest political news
