Former Central regional police boss Gideon Amala's wife has been fined Sh200,000 or serve 30 days for contempt of court. The High Court in Machakos on Wednesday found Linet Achieng' Amala guilty. This follows an application filed by lawyer Seth Atonga on behalf of Syokimau residents after she failed to appear in court several times for sentencing. Through Syokimau Residents Association, the petitioners, had in July 2017 sued Linet for constructing multiple dwelling units in an area meant for single units. She is the first respondent, the Machakos county government and the National Environmental Management Authority are the second and third respondents, respectively. Residents accused the county of irregularly approving the construction and Nema for giving the project the green light without an Environmental Impact Assessment Report. Linet apologised before Justice Oscar Angote and asked the court to give her a reasonable penalty. In mitigation, Linet said she is a mother and government employee, hence the court should not impose a prison sentence on her. The case comes up for determination on January 22, 2019.
