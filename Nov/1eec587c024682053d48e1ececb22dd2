Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has been given one more more chance to appear before a Senate committee or face unspecified sanctions. Sonko has twice failed to appear before the Public Accounts Committee to answer audit queries on county financial operations in 2014-2015. “We have summoned him to appear before us again on December 3. If he fails, then we will be forced to invoke our powers,” chairman Moses Kajwang’ said. The governor was expected to appear before the panel on Monday and Tuesday but failed to show up. But Sonko defended his failure to honour the summonses, saying the schedule he was served with stated that he was expected to appear before the committee on November 16 and 20. In a letter to Senate clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye on Monday, Sonko, through deputy county secretary Leboo Morintat, said that his position on the dates was also confirmed by the office of the Auditor General. “We are therefore seeking a clarification on the conflicting dates since a written response shall be ready for presentation on November 19 and 20,” reads the letter. But Kajwang’ said that Sonko cannot dictate to the committee the dates he should appear before it. “Why should our internal schedule be an issue to Sonko. He should have honoured the summon because he cannot set the schedules for this committee,” he said.
