COTU secretary general Francis Atwoli has asked investigative agencies to treat NCPB maize looters as economic saboteurs. In push for the lot be given severe jail terms, he said the claim that those behind the multi-billion scam come from Rift Valley is regrettable. "It is shameful that the people who stole from maize farmers come from the maize growing region. It’s like children stealing from their parents." Atwoli asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to act tough on the maize and fertiliser scams to ensure that those involved are jailed. He said the union is confident that the President's efforts to end graft were yielding positive results. Atwoli cited the case of EPZ where new chairman Paul Gicheru has streamlined operations for the benefit of workers. The Central Organisation of Trade Unions boss took a swipe at MPs accusing them of failing in their oversight role. He said lawmakers have not come out strongly to speak about corruption that has rocked key sectors of the country’s economy. "Our MPs are quiet as corruption rocks our economy. We elected them to do an oversight among other issues but they have failed us," said Atwoli. He spoke at Eldoret Baptist Church in Uasin Gishu county during the 7th Nehema Institute graduation ceremony. Atwoli said it was unfortunate "MPs have turned selfish and most of the time fight for their own interests and welfare." "Our parliamentarians must be bold enough and talk about corruption which is a now a major problem causing our youth to lack jobs." He was accompanied by COTU vice chairman Rev Joel Chebii and the Nehema director Joseph Chepkwony among other dignitaries. Click here for the latest political news
