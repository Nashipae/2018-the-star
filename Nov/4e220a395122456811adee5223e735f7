A group of Rift Valley politicians yesterday met former Governor Isaac Rutto in Bomet in what was seen as a move to cement Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential plans. The meeting which brought together Chama cha Mashinani party officials, elected leaders, former aspirants and supporters was convened by Rutto at his Chepalungu home. The eight-hour-long meeting which happens days after MPs from Mt Kenya region met in Naivasha was attended by governors Paul Chepkwony (Kericho), Samuel Tunai (Narok) and Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu).
