A 21-year old woman from Kaplel village in Baringo Central subcounty is appealing for Sh1.5 million to undergo heart surgery. Shelmit Yator (pictured) has never known happiness since she joined Form One in 2013 when doctors discovered two holes in her heart. “I was then on my way with my colleagues uphill to Kesetan Mixed Day Secondary School, five kilometres away. I suddenly vomited blood and fainted,” Yator said on Monday. Her condition forced her to rent a house near the school until she completed Form Four in 2016. She is now partially blind because of the condition. Doctors recommended surgery last year. Yator is ailing from ventricular septal defect, a form of heart disorder that is congenital or acquired through frequent upper respiratory diseases like the common cold. “I will thank God if I get healed. I would like to pursue a teaching career so I would help change my community, assist my siblings to acquire better education and build my mother a better house” Yator said. When the Cuban doctors arrived in June 2018, Yator was among the first heart patients awaiting surgery at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret but she could not be treated owing to lack of money. Yator’s poor family managed to collect only Sh50,000 at a fundraiser in September. She is the sixth in a family of 10 children. Contributions can be made via M-pesa to 0724113410.
