A charcoal dealer was admitted to Malindi subcounty hospital after he was allegedly shot by police officers on Wednesday. Juma Shanga, 28, claims he was shot by the officers after they stopped him on Marafa-Malindi road at about 1pm. He told journalists that the cops, who were driving in a Probox, shot him twice but hit him once on the shoulder. Shanga was rescued by a woman who screamed forcing the officers to 'cease fire'. He said the officers took him to Marafa hospital, ostensibly in fear after curious locals crowded the scene. "They did not talk or ask me any question after taking me to hospital. I bled for long after the shooting." Shanga said he doesn't know the whereabouts of his motorbike and the three sacks of charcoal he was transporting. Jaliwa Safari, his elder brother, said they wondered why the security personnel shot a person who was not a security threat. He said there has been a tendency of police harassing locals in Magarini subcounty. "We demand that the authorities take action against the rogue officers," Safari said. Muslims for Human Rights (MUHURI) officials condemned the act. They visited the victim at Malindi hospital. Fredrick Okado of the agency said they were still taking statements and would follow the matter to ensure he gets justice. Magarini police boss Gerald Barasa and area DCI boss Boaz Obeto said action will be taken against the officers.
