Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology union leaders have protested against plans to extend Vice Chancellor Fredrick Otieno’scontract that ended on November 26. Speaking on Wednesday at the university, the union leaders said they were concerned by the delay in appointing a new VC. They were led by Universities Academic Staff Union MMUST chapter Robinson Oduma, The leaders complained of being taken in circles when they enquired about Otieno’s replacement. They claimed to have tangible evidence that a national education official favours Otieno and intends for him to remain, despite the law and the will of the people. They want Education CS Amina Mohamed to intervene and provide a durable solution to the crisis that has created a rift between unions and the university administration. The leaders claimed Otieno was under investigation over his character. The accusations were made in a letter to CS Amina signed by Oduma of UASU, Onzere Mulongo (Kenya Universities Staff Union) and Edwin Simiyu (Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Allied Workers). CALLS UNANSWERED They wrote that the VC is under investigation for alleged misuse of cash, human resource malpractices, waste of public resources, procurement irregularities and violation of workers’ rights. Efforts by the Star to get a comment from the VC were unsuccessful as his staff said away in Nairobi and several calls to his phone went unanswered. The union leaders also criticised the way Otieno handles promotions of workers. They said that over the last five years, only a few workers allied to him have been promoted, while those who don’t back him have stagnated in the same job grade. “Prof Otieno has not been seen at the university for more than a month. He has not worked at all, we suggest to the University Council to investigate the matter because he deducts salaries of workers who are absent from work,” Oduma said.
