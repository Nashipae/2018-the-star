The leader of Minority in the Senate James Orengo has accused the EACC and the DPP of failing to take action against some senior government officials involved in graft. The Siaya Senator claimed there were 'sacred' cows being spared by the government agencies. Addressing the press at the close of a two-day meeting on advancing gender equality in Kenya at Lake Naivasha Resort, Orengo said much more needs to be done to rid the country of corruption. “Of course there are sacred cows that are being protected from facing charges and we know clearly they acquired wealth through dubious means,” he said. “We should emulate the South Africa model where a party can stand down a President for corruption allegations if we are serious in this war,” he added. Orengo also denied claims that the opposition was dead after key NASA leaders were given plum positions in government. He said the opposition leaders despite their new positions are still playing their rightful role. “If you want to mean that being in opposition is organizing street demonstrations and mass protests then you are wrong because we are doing our work in an organized manner to make sure we send Jubilee party to the opposition in the next elections,” he said. Nominated MP David Sankok on his part called on Judiciary to help in the war on corruption just as was the case with the Executive. “We want to see justice dispensed quickly for corrupt individuals so that they can have their time in prison just as is the case where a man in Nakuru was jailed instantly for slaughtering a cat,” Sankok said. “When we know that someone has stolen money and stashed it in foreign accounts what other evidence does the Judiciary require so that it can prosecute the cases without delay?” he posed.
