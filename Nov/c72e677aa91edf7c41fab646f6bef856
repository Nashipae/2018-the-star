Private sector players yesterday urged the government to speed up inspection of fertiliser at the Port of Mombasa or open up the process to them. They argued that the Kenya Bureau of Standards has been slow and that has delayed distribution, particularly to horticulture farmers. Early this month, horticulture farmers complained of a fertiliser shortage attributed to the delay at the port. Agriculture CAS Andrew Tuimur, however, assured that the farm input will be cleared in the next two weeks. He said the problem has been fixed. Tuimur spoke during a meeting with the private sector on the implementation of the Big Four agenda at Safari Park Hotel, Nairobi. Fertiliser Association of Kenya chairman Eustace Muriuki urged the government to let the private sector handle distribution. He said that since the subsidised fertiliser programmer was introduced in 2009, the average maize yield is about 12-15 bags of maize per acre. “The programme has not significantly increased the maize production and, equally, there has not been significant increase in fertiliser usage, contrary to reports by the government on increase in fertiliser usage,” Muriuki said. The private sector called for policy and regulatory environment that is conducive to business in the food production industry. Tuimur said public investment in agriculture has not been adequate to create the desired transformation for increased production. “Ensuring food and nutrition security to all Kenyans continues to be a challenge despite the numerous initiatives to enhance production and productivity for crops, livestock and fisheries value chains,” he said.
