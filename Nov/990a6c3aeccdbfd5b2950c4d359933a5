From Monday PSVs will no longer be allowed to enter the Central Business District of Nairobi (see P23). PSVs will now drop passengers at terminals at Muthurwa, Fig Tree A and B, Desai Road, Park Road, Ngara Road, Machakos and Hakati. The CBD does suffer from serious congestion but this will inconvenience commuters who will have to walk a long way to work. Even connecting will be a problem. If you are travelling from Westlands to Mlolongo, you will have to go to Fig Tree and then walk three kilometres to the railway station terminus. The few connecting buses remaining in the CBD will be totally inadequate. Nairobi county's decision is upside down. In most big cities, private vehicles are banned from the CBD, not public transport (that includes matatus). The county should be working to set up light railways and trams for Nairobi. That is the progressive way to reduce congestion. As it is, accessibility to public transport in Nairobi will get worse from Monday onwards. We expect better from East Africa's capital city.
