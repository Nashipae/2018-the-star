The Kitui Ndengu Revolution and county health insurance cover are some of the key achievements of Governor Charity Ngilu’s administration. Giving the state of the county address at the Kitui assembly yesterday, Ngilu said residents are food sufficient as a result of the success of the Ndengu revolution. More than 49 million kilogrammes of ndengu (green grams) were produced in the last rainy season. Ngilu promised to purchase a processing and packaging plant to brand and market the ndengu. She said 100,000 households have been registered for the health cover launched three months ago. “I owe a big debt of gratitude to this assembly for the great support you have given this health insurance cover, from reviewing and approving its regulations, to supporting community mobilisation.” Click here for the latest political news
