Citizen TV Journalist Jacque Maribe wants state counsel Catherine Mwaniki to be disqualified from prosecuting her murder case. In an application filed in court, Maribe claims Mwaniki failed to ensure she is supplied with documents and statements that will be used in her trial. Maribe says the DPP has violated her rights in the case by failing to comply with court orders issued by the court. She further wants the court to compel the prosecution to furnish her with documents that will be used in the trial. She wants the state to surrender back her house and car being held by police. Maribe was charged alongside her then fiancee Joseph Irungu with the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani. They denied the charge and she was released on Sh1 million bail. Justice James Wakiaga denied Irungu bail. The case will be mentioned today.
