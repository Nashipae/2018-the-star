A man whose body was found dumped in Arabuko Sokoke Forest last Sunday died from strangulation, a postmortem has revealed. Mwangirani Saidi went missing on October 25. The postmortem report shows his lower jaw, fingers from both hands and his feet were missing. The postmortem was conducted yesterday by pathologist Mbuko Ng’ali at the Kilifi County Hospital Mortuary. It was witnessed by family members and civil society organisations. Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid asked police to comb the forest for the missing body parts. Khalid said the National Land Commission should urgently address land issues at the Coast, saying it was the cause of mysterious killings. “ We have information that Saidi could have been killed because of land issues. This is the 43rd landrelated death at the Coast this year. We are following up with the DCI,” Khalid said. He said they were awaiting a toxicology report after the pathologist took samples for analysis. “The body had no shirt and we suspect they used his shirt to strangle him. The toxicology report will be able to confirm this,” Khalid said. He asked police to enhance security saying other people were missing in Kilifi. “Police must ensure the perpetrators are brought to book because we do not know who is next,” he said. Institute for Human Rights executive director Eric Karisa called for a quick probe. Saidi will be buried today at his home in Seahorse area.
