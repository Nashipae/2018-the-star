Religious leaders have been advised to adopt national values in their teachings to help combat corruption. "Education and adoption of national values in religious teachings is vital in order to foster a joint fight against corruption," Archbishop Stephen Marete of the National Independent Church of Africa said on Monday. He was speaking in Nairobi during a Multi Sectoral Initiative conference that drew leaders from the government, trade unions, civil society and media. "Majority of the nation’s population considers themselves as religiously inclined and hence religious leaders are the tipping point of noticeable change in society," a joint statement from the leaders said. "MSI has full confidence in the Inter Religious Council of Kenya (IRCK) from a national to the grass root level to carry out and effective change and have an unshakable stance against the vice that is corruption," it added. EACC on September 26, adopted a study guide 'Integrity: A Weapon Against Corruption', to boost its fight against corruption.
