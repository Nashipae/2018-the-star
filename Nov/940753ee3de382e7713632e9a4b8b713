King Kaka sold rabbits as a child because of the struggles his mother was going through, making them even skip meals. "I started selling rabbits in class one in Malingo estates," Kaka told Word Is. The Dundaing hit maker started business to also cater for his school fees "I said I want a different storyline for my life and also give my children the best life as well. I started business in high school. I was business-minded, selling kaimati, clothes, so I would manage to pay my school fees in both high school and college. That same spirit I have taken it to music and my empire," he said. King Kaka will be releasing his fifth album, 'Eastlando Royalty', on November 30 at Uhuru Gardens.
