Pineapple producer Del Monte failed to show up yesterday for land dispute mediation with Murang’a residents, further delaying a protracted court battle. The National Land Commission had invited Del Monte and Kandara Residents Association  to a forum to satisfy a court order to try to settle the matter out of court. “We have received a letter from Del Monte saying they will not be attending,” NLC Commissioner Dr Samuel Tororei said. He was accompanied by commissioners Rose Musyoka and Emma Njogu. The Kandara Welfare Association has been demanding Del Monte cede 6,500 acres for community use, claiming company land was taken from their forefathers without any compensation. Kandara residents thronged the venue. The Environment and Lands court sitting in Murang’a issued an order on October 3, urging the parties to negotiate a possible-out-of-court settlement. Parties involved in mediation include the Murang’a and Kiambu residents’ associations, the Murang’a county assembly and the county government of Kiambu. Citing confidentiality, Tororei said he could not reveal the reasons why the company did not attend. Those attending included Murang’a county assembly speaker Nduati Kariuki. “This is waste of time and resources, mediation is purely based on good will of all parties,” Tororei said before adjourning. Nduati said it was “disturbing when parties do not turn up.” The speaker warned that the operations of the company may be grounded should mediation fail to proceed. Adjournment made the association furious. Members said the company has done little to help them since the colonial era. Del Monte has been in operation since 1965. It is one of the largest exporters of canned fruits, with an estimated annual revenue of Sh4.5 billion. Del Monte has a processing capacity of 1,500 tonnes of pineapples daily.
