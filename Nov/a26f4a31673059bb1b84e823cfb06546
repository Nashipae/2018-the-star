Al Azaar School in Garissa county produced the best KCPE candidate in Northeastern for the second year running. KCPE results were released at Star of the Sea Primary School, Mombasa on Monday. It was song and dance at the school located in Bula Mzuri in the outskirts of Garissa town after it emerged that Abdirahman Aden, 16, topped the region with 428 marks. Last year, Insat Abdullahi, a former student at the school, emerged best in the region after scoring 410 marks. She admitted to Limuru Girls Secondary School. Others who scored over 400 marks from the school were: AhmedQadar Mohamed (424), Abdirahman Aden (418), Mohamed Abdi (409), Abdifatah Mohamed (405), Shueb Mukhtar (402) and Ifrah Muhumed (402). Abdifatah, 16, said he expected to perform well but not be among the region's top candidates. He hopes to join Starehe Boys Centre and become an engineer. "As a region, we are short of engineers which have affected our development since we are forced to outsource for expertise. I hope and pray I will fix the problem as an engineer," Abdifatah said. The school’s manager Ahmed Sambur said the results were achieved through hard work, determination, and cooperation from all the parents, teachers and students. "One person cannot achieve such splendid results. It takes maximum cooperation to achieve this. The work we have done can now be seen," he said. Click here for the latest political news
