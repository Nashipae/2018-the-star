Vera Sidika and Otile Brown have been playing their East African fans. It turns out that before the two split, they were running pure publicity stunts. According to an article posted yesterday by Tanzania’s Dizzim, a close friend to Otile said the Deja Vu hitmaker wrote Vera Sidika’s song Nalia, a song the socialite has made her debut with. The icing on the cake is that Sidika used Otile’s Tanzanian friend Calisah as her video vixen. Tanzanian media pundits report that Otile linked Vera with Calisah to get into the Tanzanian market, as he is one of the known drama kings in the “+255”, who first hit the headlines when a sex tape of himself and Wema Sepetu went viral. It is, however, official that Otile and Vera aren’t friends anymore, after the socialite said he has a small cassava.
