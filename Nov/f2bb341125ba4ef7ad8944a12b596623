Parents have been urged to closely watch their daughters during the holiday to prevent teenage pregnancies. Cases of teen pregnancies are on the rise. Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary for Bungoma branch Ken Nganga yesterday said parents need do more after many girls gave birth during the KCPE exam. Yesterday, scores of others were forced to write their KSCE exams in hospital after deliveries. Ng’anga said such cases should not be reported next year. He asked parents to give their children proper guidance to avoid sex and pregnancies when the first term starts  January next year. “The schools have closed and the children are now with their parents. We’re asking them to give them proper guidance,”  Ng’anga said. Girls Advocacy Initiative director Rebecca Masibayi said teachers have done their part when the children were in school. Masibayi accused parents of abdicating their duties. “That is putting too much pressure on the teachers  to mould the children,” Masibayi said.
