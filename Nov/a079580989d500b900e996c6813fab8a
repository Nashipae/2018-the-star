Security officers in Laikipia county have driven out over 2,000 head of cattle from the neighbouring counties that were grazing in private ranches, farms and government lands illegally. County commissioner Onesmus Musyoki yesterday said the animals, some belonging to senior politicians, had invaded private land in the last two weeks. "Some of the cattle flushed out belong to former Samburu Central Member of Parliament Lati Lelelit. As security committee of the county, we will drive all those animals out," Musyoki said. At the same time, the county commissioner said police officers are pursuing an unknown number of cattle rustlers who stole four heads of cattle and sheep and fled towards Baringo county. Therustlers shot in the air twice at Matwiku village in Laikipia West subcounty before fleeing with the animals towards Laikipia Nature conservancy and by Monday morning they had not been recovered. Musyoki warned that invaders will not be allowed to disrupt the peace that has been experienced in the county. Click here for the latest political news
