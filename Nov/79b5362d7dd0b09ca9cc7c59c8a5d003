President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday launched the newly formed Kenya Coast Guard Service at Liwatoni in Mombasa. Uhuru said the Coast Guard service will help increase efficiency in protection of maritime resources. "It will enforce security, safety, and protection of Kenya's maritime resources," Uhuru said. The President appointed Brigadier Vincent Loonena as the pioneer Director General of the Kenya Coast Guard Service last Thursday. Loonena will oversee the protection of the country’s waters against dumping of harmful wastes and pollutants, search and rescue services, and the arrest of illegal fishermen. Among those who accompanied Uhuru were Deputy President William Ruto, Mombasa governor Hassan Joho, Leader of Majority Aden Duale,  Tourism CS Najib Balala and Interior's Fred Matiang'i. Matiang'i assured Kenyans the ministry was serious about protecting maritime resources. "We will deal with illegal fishing and are ready to protect all our resources," he said."Our responsibility is to ensure the security of all our people, not negotiate with others. We will not negotiate with our marine resources and marine integrity." The President is also expected to launch the Eat More Fish Campaign to encourage Kenyans to eat more fish.
