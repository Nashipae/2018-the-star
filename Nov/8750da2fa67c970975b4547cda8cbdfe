Parklands head coach Kul Suri has challenged his players to replicate the performance they displayed on Wednesday against Wazalendo in their final Kenya Hockey Union men’s Premier League fixture against 2016 champions Strathmore University Gladiators. Parklands relieved their piling relegation pressure with a hard fought 3-2 win over pre-match favourites Wazalendo on Wednesday evening at City Park to confirm their place in the top flight league. Parklands were part of the bottom six teams fighting to evade the drop prior to the match, but Suri’s charges overcame the star-studded Wazalendo who were seeking to scale two places up on the log to place third. The win took Parklands, who were initially seventh with 23 points a place high on the log, surpassing Nairobi Sikh who have a match in hand. The three points gained also catapulted them to three points shy of Wazalendo who remained fifth with 29 points and a match in hand. Suri credited the win to the team’s preparations and challenged his players to carry the same form and spirit to the final league fixture against Gladiators. “We had good preparations for the match and I am happy the players fought for the three points against Wazalendo who offered strong challenge. We now shift our attention to the final fixture of the season against Gladiators, where we will try and wrap the season on a winning note.”
