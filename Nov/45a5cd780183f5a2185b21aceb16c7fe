Two police officers have been sentenced to death for killing the late Bomachoge MP Joel Onyancha's bodyguard and the latter's two relatives in Kangemi. Police Constables Benjamin Changawa and Stanley Okoti were sentenced to death after being found guilty of the offence committed on October 7, 2014. Making the ruling on Wednesday, Justice Stella Mutuku said she was satisfied 'beyond reasonable doubt' with all the ingredients of murder in the three counts jointly facing the accused persons. "I find sufficient evidence to prove that the seceded persons died as shown in the counts of murder and that their deaths are unlawful," she said. Mutuku said she found sufficient evidence to prove that the accused persons acted outside the law in performing their duties and shot to death the three deceased. "...I reject their respective defenses and find the defense of self defense is not available," she added. Earlier this month, a court held that the prosecution had proven beyond doubted that the two killed the three said persons.
