Migori Governor Okoth Obado has been released on Sh500,000 bond or a cash bail of Sh200,000. Kibera Law Court Chief Magistrate Joyce Gandani said the prosecution did not provide enough evidence that Obado will interfere with investigations into the illegal possession of guns charges he is facing. "There are no compelling reasons to detain him. He is not a flight risk and is not likely to tamper with witnesses," Gandani said. The prosecution had sought 15 days to detain the Governor so as to conclude investigations to establish whether the guns were licensed. "An arrested person has the right to be released on bond before or after being brought in court unless there are compelling reasons not to," she added. Prosecutor Catherine Mwaniki on Thursday argued that the Governor should be denied bail because it is a matter of public interest. Mwaniki further said Obado failed to give an account of how the eight guns recovered at his two homes came to be in his possession. In his affidavit, however, Obado said he has always cooperated and collaborated with security agencies and has never breached any terms of bail. "I shall abide by all terms of the bond or bail if granted. That I have always cooperated and collaborated with security agencies before and will continue to do so," he said. The embattled governor is also facing a murder charge of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. He further faces probe on accusations of embezzling Sh2.5 billion county funds through his proxies.
