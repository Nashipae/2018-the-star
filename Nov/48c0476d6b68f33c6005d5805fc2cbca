Eleven-time Kenya Premier League champions Tusker have acquired the services of left-back Sammy Mejja from Thika United. The free spending brewers, who have signed five players so far, embarked on beefing up their squad this week before the new season, where they will be seeking to end their two-year silverware drought. Initially, Tusker had signed Rwandan international Muzerwa Amin from Police FC, Clyde Senaji, a Vihiga United product who was loaned to AFC Leopards last season before raiding Nzoia Sugar for towering centre back Hillary Wandera. On Tuesday, the club made a statement of ending their long wait for a trophy with the acquisition of 2017 Most Valuable Player (MVP) Michael Madoya from Zoo Kericho and yesterday, Mejja followed suit and he is expected to muscle for the starting berth with David Gateri and Erick Ambunya. The exit of Mejja from Thika who are set to debut in the National Super League (NSL) leaves them with a largely inexperienced squad as majority of senior players have ditched the club while others are reportedly forcing their way out. Thika have so far lost Baraka Badi and Michael Mutinda to KCB while Samuel Chege has joined second tier FC Talanta. Fast-rising rookie James Kinyanjui who is on the radar of senior clubs is also understood to be nearing the exit door in search of playing time elsewhere. Mejja expressed delight in joining the brewers. “I would like to thank Tusker FC for giving me this opportunity to play. I have played with some of my new teammates and I know everyone here wants to win; I have the same ambition as them. Hopefully, we can push each other to achieve that.”
