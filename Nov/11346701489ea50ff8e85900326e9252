Kenya has received a Sh27.4 billion loan from the African Development Bank to complete Thwake dam in Ukambani. The dam will cover Makueni, Machakos and Kitui counties and will provide drinking water, hydroelectric energy and water for irrigation. In a statement released yesterday, AfDB said this is in addition to another Sh8.9 billion loan granted by the bank in 2013 to start building the dam as part of the Thwake Multi-Purpose Development Programme. “The loan was from the Africa Growing Together Fund and completion of the 80.5 metre-high multi-purpose dam will enable the storage of 681 million cubic metres of water. 625 million cubic metres will be used for electricity production and downstream irrigation of agricultural land, while 22 million cubic metres will be used for upstream irrigation and 34 million for human use,” said AfDB. On September 25, Water and Sanitation Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui said a total of Sh2.8 billion had been paid to compensate 1, 606 people affected by the dam. Speaking during a leaders meeting, Chelugui said the Treasury had provided adequate funds to compensate the remaining 186 people. “Processing of payment is ongoing and approximately Sh700 million will be remitted to the National Land Commission for disbursement,” he said. He added that approximately 9,158 acres of land will be acquired for the dam project, affecting 1,792 households at a total cost of approximately Sh3.68 billion. Construction of the initial phase of the Thwake Multi-Purpose Development Programme should be completed in December 2022. This will be followed by three further phases that will include construction of hydraulic plants to treat up to 34,600 cubic metres of water for household use for 674,700 villagers and up to 117,200 cubic metres for 640,000 residents in Konza city. Another phase will include hydroelectric energy production and the third phase will have 40,000 ha of irrigation. Click here for the latest political news
