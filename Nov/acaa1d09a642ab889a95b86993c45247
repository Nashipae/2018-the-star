An auctioneering firm has impounded two Egerton University University vehicles assigned to senior officers over a Sh15 million debt. The auctioneers stormed at the university's compound and impounded vice-chancellor Rose Mwonya's Toyota Prado and a double cabin belonging to the procurement officer. The firm said it was executing a court order in a matter between James Mwathi Nguri, a former finance officer who filed a suit on September 20, 2012, against the institution. “Nguri sued the institution over dismissal on fictitious grounds. The case was heard and determined by the Employment and Labour Relations Court and was awarded Sh15 million," said an auctioneer' s employee who sought to remain anonymous. The court also found the termination was unfair in substance and procedure. It further awarded the former employee six months gross salaries for unfair termination being Sh1,730,000.00 at a gross last monthly pay of Sh288,350.00. "In making the award, the court considered that the respondent (Egerton University) was willing to pay six months notice of the termination notice and which is hereby awarded to the claimant at Sh1,7 million, " the court stated. When contacted on the auction issue, Prof Mwonya, who was last month reinstated by the court after being irregularly suspended by the University Council said she could not comment on the matter. The debt burden of public universities has caused outrage and University managers have warned that such institutions of higher learning might shut by end of next year due to rising debt. The vice-chancellor said the institutions were in the grip of a financial crisis by owing various regulators more than Sh7 billion in agency fees and Sh4 billion owed in salary arrears.
