The government decision buy maize at Sh2,300 per 90kg bag has sparked anger among farmers and MPs in the North Rift who have threatened to protest if price is not increased to Sh3,200. The farmers and leaders said the government offer is too low and they will make losses due to higher production costs. They have appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and revert to Sh3,200 which NCPB has been paying them since last year. The Cabinet approved purchase of two million bags from farmers but the producers say the amount is too low as production this year will exceed 40 million bags. Director of the Kenya Farmers Association Kipkorir Menjo said they would summon a crisis meeting to chart the way forward. “We are unhappy with the price and we will meet to determine the next course of action,” Menjo said. Other farmer representatives opposed to the price are David Chepsiya from Moiben and John Kibet. “Our production cost per bag is about Sh2,710. The government price means we will make a loss of about Sh400 per bag,” Chepsiya said. MPs Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills), Joshua Kuttuny (Cherangany) and Silas Tiren (Moiben) have said they would lead farmers in protests if the state fails to increase the price in two weeks. “That price is unfair to farmers. We still ask the President to have it increased,” Tiren said.
