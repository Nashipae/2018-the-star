Kenyatta National Hospital has assured cancer patients that cancer drugs are in stock at the facility. The assurance followed reports in a section of the media that stocks had run dry, potentially putting the lives of hundreds of cancer patients who depend on supplies from the hospital at risk. In a statement on Sunday, acting chief executive Dr. Thomas Mutie said the available medicines include Vincristine, Doxorubicin, Allopurinol, Cisplatin and Cyclophosphamide. “However, Mercaptopurine and Carboplatin are the drugs that are not available in the hospital but had been awarded to the supplier for delivery,” Mutie said. He attributed the lack of the two drugs to the fact that there are limited suppliers licensed to supply specific cancer drugs at KNH. Mutie further explained that there is only one brand of Mercaptopurine that is registered for use in the Kenya but the drug is currently unavailable in the country. “KNH had earlier awarded contract for the supply of the unavailable cancer drugs which were delivered but rejected because they failed to meet the required specifications,” Mutie said. He said a different supplier has since been conducted and is expected to deliver Carboplatin on Monday. “The hospital is making every effort to source for the unavailable medicine from the alternative suppliers,” Mutie said. In July, there was worry amongst breast cancer patients at KNH after Herceptin, the drug that cures early stages of the disease, ran out of stock. This was attributed to the Ministry of Health's failure to honour its commitment on procurement. Cancer patients at KNH access the drugs free of charge. Click here for the latest political news
