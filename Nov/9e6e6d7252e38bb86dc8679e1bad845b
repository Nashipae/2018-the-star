Lamu women hoping to join the KDF expressed anger after being left out of the ongoing recruitment on Monday. The recruitment is taking place at the Kibaki Grounds. Lieutenant Paul Aruasa said there were enough women recruits and said those who missed would be considered in future recruitment drives. Last year, women hopefuls were locked out on similar grounds.

We know it’s a disappointment to many, but so far, we have enough female recruits. But things will change in future recruitment drives," he said. However, the women questioned why the KDF did not make the announcement earlier on. Loice Kazungu, 23, was attempting to join the forces for the third time. "I am frustrated. I have run on this pitch every single year for the last three years. I scored C plain in KCSE and I meet all required standards of weight, height and general body well-being. But I have never been lucky. Every time they tell me they are not taking women," she said. Susan Wangoi, 35, expressed similar frustration. "This is the fourth time I am doing this and someone tells me they don’t need more women in the forces. What happened to gender balance?" she said. At least 200 men and women turned up for the recruitment. Many people's hopes were dashed due to having discloured teeth, tattoos and low KCSE grades.
