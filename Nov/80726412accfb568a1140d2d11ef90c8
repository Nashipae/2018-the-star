Deputy President William Ruto has urged MPs to put their selfish interests aside and support the Gender Bill to have more women nominated to Parliament. Ruto said on Saturday that women and girls comprise half of the Kenyan population and it is wrong for them to remain out of leadership. He spoke during his tour of Kitutu Chache North, Bobasi and Bomachoge Chache constituencies. He presided over fundraisers in aid of Catholic and SDA churches. Also present were Kisii governor James Ongwae, deputy governor Joash Maangi, MPs Richard Tong’i (Nyaribari Chache), Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache South), Jimmy Angwenyi (Kitutu Chache South), Alfah Miruka (Bomachoge Chache), Zadock Oguttu (Bomachoge Borabu) and John Oroo (Bonchari). The lawmakers assured the DP that they will back the bill tomorrow. The DP urged leaders to stop politicking. Politics of competition will create enmity and hatred among Kenyans, he said. He said Jubilee’s main agenda is to ensure more Kenyans have electricity, water and roads to enable them go on with their development activities. Ruto told those eyeing positions in 2022, especially the presidency, to hold their horses until the right time comes. Kenyans will decide on the leader they want, he said. "We’re not ready for innuendoes. Our main purpose is to serve the people as we promised during our campaign," he said. Ruto thanked the Abagusii community for their prayers, which allowed President Uhuru Kenyatta “to form an all-inclusive government”. He said they are not ready to discuss issues of parties, positions and leadership because those been overtaken by events. In one month, the government will provide a working CT scan to Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital, Ruto said. Click here for the latest political news
