Three police reservists have been killed during a bandit attack on Wednesday night. The three were shot dead at Kalua in Igembe Central during an apparent retaliatory mission by suspected Turkana bandits. Confirming the incident, acting Igembe Central OCPD Rashid Hulbale said two other reservists sustained gunshot injuries in the ambush and are receiving treatment at Isiolo hospital.

Kiringo also asked authorities to probe the Dadaab location chief in Tigania East over the increased attacks. "Why didn’t the Rapid Deployment Unit and Anti-stock theft officers at Mbatalu and at Mariara fail to respond during the attacks? We want the Dadaab chief to be transferred immediately," the MP said. Last week, Interior CAS Ntutu and National Assembly security committee chairman Paul Koinange toured the area and assured residents of improved security to end the attacks.
