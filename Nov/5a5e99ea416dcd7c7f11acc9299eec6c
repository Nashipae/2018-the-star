ODM leader Raila Odinga has allegedly blocked Miguna Miguna on Twitter denying him audience on his social media account. Lawyer Miguna Miguna made the announcement on Saturday morning terming it as a cowardly move. He said Raila's move will not cloud the planned release of his new book "TREASON: The Case Against Tyrants and Renegades". "It's going to be an explosive revolutionary engagement ahead," he tweeted on Saturday.

The self-declared NRMKe leader was denied entry into the country on March 26 after he refused to apply for a visa that grants him legal stay in Kenya.
