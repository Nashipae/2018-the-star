A USIU student on Wednesday won Sh547,011 with Jambo Bet after predicting results of an NBA game between Sacramento Kings and Washington Wizards. The game ended 116-112 for the two teams respectively. James Nzau, 25, a final year International Relations student, said this was the biggest bet he has ever won, the first being Sh27,000 after placing Sh3,000. Nzau, an accomplished part-time DJ, said the first winning boosted his confidence. "A friend topped up my Sh3,000 bet amount with Sh3,000 more," he said. "This is the biggest bet I have ever won. I will spend part of it to pay my parents rent as well as school fees for myself, my sister," Nzau said. Jambo Bet marketing boss Ivory Musyoki said: "We have a lot in store for our clients and are determined to provide the best gaming experience." She spoke at the handover ceremony at the firm's offices in Nairobi. Click here for the latest political news
