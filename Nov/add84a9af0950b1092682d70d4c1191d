Newly-promoted Western Stima have raided Posta Rangers for the services of centre half Luke Ochieng and utility Kennedy Otieno. Stima lured the two to ditch Sammy ‘Pamzo’ Omollo’s coached Rangers after undergoing a week long training with them at their backyard in Kisumu. The powermen, who were readmitted back to the Kenya Premier League after spending a year in the National Super League expect the duo to walk straight into the starting 11 thanks to their vast experience. The capture of Ochieng is seen as a direct replacement for Geoffrey Ochieng, who signed for Gor Mahia while Otieno, famously referred as ‘Agogo’ is set to bring more competition in the midfield. According to the club’s chairman Laban Jobita the two were signed thanks for their vast experience in the top flight. “We have signed the two from Rangers after impressing in the period they have trained with us. They joined us on Monday and have impressed for the short time and hence we have incorporated them in our team. They bring top flight experience and I believe they will help us remain competitive at the top level. It is good to have Ochieng now that we have lost Geoffrey to Gor.” Jobita further expressed optimism in signing six more players before the start of the new season, on December 8, where Ochieng and Otieno will face their former employers in the opener. The club is rumored to be closing on the signature of Kibera Black Stars talisman Henry Onyango, who netted 11 goals in last season’s NSL. “I want to sign six more experienced players before we begin the new season with the aim of complementing the ones we have around. We have identified them and I can confirm that negotiations are ongoing,” said Jobita.
