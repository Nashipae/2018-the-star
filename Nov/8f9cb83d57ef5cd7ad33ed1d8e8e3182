Slain wife of former Kakamega DC Paul Yatich has finally been laid to rest at her husband's home in Talai, Baringo on Thursday. Hundreds turned up for the emotional sendoff of Loise Yatich whose lifeless body was found murdered inside her house at Kiplombe in Eldoret, Uasin-Gishu County on October 13. "To my dear wife and loving mother of my children it has been a pleasure having you around and no one can fill the gap you left, rest in peace" Yatich read in his tribute. Although the two separated 10 years ago, Yatich claimed Loise remained his legal wife as they had not divorced. On Wednesday last week, the deceased's sister Esther Chirchir sought a court injunction stopping the burial arrangements over unsettled family issues.

Present in the burial were former Kenya's Basic Education Director Leah Rotich who is also a relative to the family. On Wednesday, a herdsman was charged in an Eldoret court with the murder.

He was also charged with robbery with violence and handling stolen property valued at more than Sh400,000 belonging to the deceased.
