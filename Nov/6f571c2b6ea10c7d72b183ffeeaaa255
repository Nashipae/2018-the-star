At least six people have been killed in one week in Junda ward, Kisauni. Police suspect a return of an underground militia group motivated by politics. The six were killed by a gang of three in police attire and IDs. Despite carrying guns, the gang kills victims by hacking them using pangas or an axe. The gang appears to know their way around Junda ward and use relatively new Boxer motorcycles for their movement. On Thursday evening four people, including a husband and wife, were killed in Kasarani, when the gang in police uniform and armed with guns stormed a video cafÃ© where residents were watching football. "They ordered us to lie down before identifying themselves as police officers, even showing us AP IDs," Karisa Charo said. The husband and wife heard the commotion and went out of their house to see what was happening. They were slashed to death. On Friday evening they attacked Kidagaya, where they killed two people who were responding to distress calls. Five days before, a boda boda rider had been shot dead in Bengala. The same gang is suspected to have killed him. Kisauni deputy county commissioner Kipchumba Ruto on Saturday said the three only target the head, an indication they have undergone through some form of training. "They never steal. They just kill. Someone must have trained them and finances them," he said at security barazas at Kidagaya and Kasarani. Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo said there is more than meets the eye in the attacks and wants the National Intelligence Service to uncover the story behind the bizarre attacks. "This is not just a security issue anymore. This is a different thing," he said. Mbogo said the attacks have only been concentrated in Junda ward, one of his strongholds. The Junda terrain is ragged and needs someone with knowledge of the area to manoeuvre around the area. It used to be the safest ward in Kisauni. The ward is separated from Tudor by the sea. Mbogo said if the attacks continue in the next two weeks, he will move a motion in Parliament seeking to have youth in Kisauni armed so at to protect themselves. He said Kisauni is a vast constituency which cannot be protected by police alone. Ruto supported the idea of Kisauni being given police reservists. He said the vast constituency only has two police stations and an AP post. "We need help from the community and other stakeholders. I support the MP on the Kenya Police Reservists," Ruto said. But Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet yesterday ruled out the possibility of deploying police reservist to restore peace in Kisauni. He said his officers are capable of handling the situation without forming a special unit. "We don’t need reservists in Mombasa at this point. We have sufficient officers to do that job. Should we think that we require a police reservist, we will make that decision at the right time and not now," Boinnet said. Boinnet spoke in Mombasa at Kenya School of Government when he met commanders from Coast ahead of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s visit today. Boinnet, however, acknowledged the urgency to tame the killings. Click here for the latest political news
