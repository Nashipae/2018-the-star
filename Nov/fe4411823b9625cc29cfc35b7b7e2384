The government has moved to restore order and sanity in the chaotic and yet important public transport sector from today. But even as the government vows brutal action on the cartels and those who donâ€™t obey traffic rules, some matatu operators are threatening to boycott,a move that is aimed at blackmailing the government to rescind the notice. But that should not happen. Rules must be implemented to the letter and in sustained manner. It is important that the sector provides Kenyans with adequate, effective, efficient and safe transport services. We urge that efforts to clean up the sector should go beyond the registration of saccos and arresting those who break traffic rules with impunity, to dealing with the traffic officers who take bribes and look the other way. The efforts should also ensure the owners of PSVs take responsibility for the their actions or inactions, have valid and binding contracts with their employees and ensure their cars are roadworthy. Setting daily cash targets for drivers is a major cause of dangerous and reckless driving. The mad rush by matatu crews is to meet targets and make something on the side for themselves. The rules must be enforced with such vigour as to change the culture of public transport.
