More than 60 churchgoers have been arrested in Turkana after they were found drunk. The members of My Father’s Blessings Ministry were nabbed on Sunday and later released because of poor health. Turkana Central police boss David Mburukua said they were emaciated. “California village has the highest number of drunkards as most of them brew local alcohol ‘kaada’ day and night for survival. Drunkards are taking advantage of the church,” he said. Pastor Peter Ekatorot said his mission is to rescue drunkards so they can convert. He urged police to help him change lives.
