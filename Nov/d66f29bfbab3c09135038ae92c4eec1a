Arsenal moved to within one point of the Premier League top four and extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 17 games with victory at Bournemouth. The Gunners took the lead thanks to a spectacular own goal from Cherries midfielder Jefferson Lerma, who volleyed Sead Kolasinac’s cross past Asmir Begovic from 15 yards. Joshua King, making his comeback after four games out with an ankle injury, finished off a swift counter-attacking move to bring the hosts level seconds before half-time. But Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored what proved to be the winner after the break when he converted Kolasinac’s cross for his eighth Premier League goal of the season. Despite the defeat, Bournemouth stay eighth in the table but have now lost their past three league matches. The Cherries were aggrieved early on when David Brooks had a goal ruled out for offside, with replays suggesting he was marginally behind Shkodran Mustafi when the ball was played. But that proved the catalyst for a confident display from Arsenal, who secured their fourth Premier League away win of the campaign - equalling their tally for the whole of last season. Meanwhile, Sean Dyche hopes Burnley can continue the improvement they showed against Leicester before the international break when they resume their campaign at home to Newcastle tonight. The Clarets put a three-game losing run, during which they conceded 13 goals, behind them by holding the Foxes to a goalless draw on an emotional afternoon as the King Power Stadium remembered late Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. Dyche said: “I thought the structure of the side was better. I thought it looked more like what we look like on a consistent level of performance. There’s still more to come.
