Fast-rising comedians Propesa have said they are okay after being involved in an accident yesterday morning. They sought to assure fans of their safety after they posted a picture of their car upside down in a bad state. "We were driving from Athi River to Nairobi and at Mlolongo, some reckless driver hit us. Our vehicle rolled to the ditch and overturned, but we are happy no one has a problem," comedian Kimutai Ruto aka Propesa told Word Is. "The doctor confirmed we are all fine after we went for check-up." The comedians are also working on mentoring young upcoming comedians. "We think God has a lot for us and he expects a lot from us. We are mentoring young talents from Rift Valley, who are doing comedy as a business," Kimutai said. "We are starting something with our social media platforms to get other people to do the same like we do. We need them to exhibit what they have in our platforms, and then if the public likes what they are doing, then from there you can get on and open their platforms and start earning something for themselves." Propesa caught the attention of many, including the who’s who in Kenyan corporates, after winning a bet against SporPesa CEO Ronald Karauri, walking ‘away’ with his Range Rover.
