You may be unaware that there is before the Senate the Care
and Protection of Older Members of Society Bill. It has had its second reading (the main debate on general
principles). This private member’s Bill is intended to give effect to Article
57 of the Constitution. What does that say? It focusses on the duty of the State (meaning
governments and public institutions) to take measures so that older persons
enjoy their rights to participate fully in society generally, to pursue their
personal development, to live in dignity and respect, free from abuse and to
receive reasonable care and assistance from their family and the State. You will remember that the Constitution prohibits
discrimination on the basis of age. So, even without Article 57, the older
among us have most of the rights mentioned here. We all (you all – for I am
among the elderly) have them: Not to be excluded from society, to pursue our
personal development, live in dignity and not be abused. And, like all rights,
not only the state but everyone, including individuals and companies, must
respect those rights. The State must not just obey the rights, but protect
them, promote (encourage and support) and sometimes fulfil them (that is positively
act upon including through public financing where necessary). “Reasonable care and assistance from … the State” is a right
that perhaps goes further than the younger and able-bodied would be able to
claim. What Article 57 really does is to recognise that the rights
of the elderly (defined as those over 60) may sometimes need specific, targeted
action, that a hands-off approach may not be enough. It takes a similar
approach to rights of children and youth, persons with disability and
marginalised groups. Kenyans may like to say, “We love and respect the wazee”, but perhaps various pressures
have led to some breakdown in respect for the elders. We have all read about
treatment of the elderly that suggests this. Poor treatment can include the
passive: not spending time with the elderly, stimulating them to keep their
brains active, ensuring that they eat well, ensuring that they can vote, and
understand the issues on which they may vote, taking steps to get relevant
care, hearing aids, walking sticks etc. It may be much worse: Physical abuse
stemming from frustration with slow thought processes and deafness, fraud â€•
taking advantage of illiteracy, poor sight, lack of technology skills â€• through
the dumping of elderly relatives in hospital, to killing the white-haired for
imagined witchcraft.  THE LANGUAGE OF RIGHTS The title of the Bill troubled me somewhat. “Care and
protection” suggests a rather passive receipt of state generosity and care,
rather than an entitlement to rights. Article 57 is very rights oriented, not
“Let’s look after the poor old people” oriented! However, the Bill is mainly
limited to the provision of care homes and other facilities for the elderly, so
perhaps the name is appropriate. But the Bill does go a bit beyond care homes and the like.
And its text also sometimes uses language that comes across as rather
condescending, rather than that of rights. We old folks can fully participate
in the affairs of our community and hold any position “suitable” and based on our
“interests and capabilities”, and participate in activities that “promote our
wellbeing”. Why does society think it can tell older people what is good for
them, when others can choose?  THAT’S NOT ALL You may also not know that there is a National Policy on
Older Persons and Ageing, revised in the light of the Constitution. Some of its
specific goals are to make possible the provision of reasonable care and
assistance by families and the state, and encourage the involvement of older
persons in development as well as protection from abuse. The United Nations
Human Rights Council has appointed an Independent Expert on the enjoyment of
all human rights by older persons, and the African Union has a Special Treaty
on the Rights of Older Persons. But only five countries have so far signed this treaty and Kenya
is not one of them. Yet the treaty has useful provisions. It talks about the
rights of the elderly to make their own decisions and express their opinions, the
need for elimination of harmful practices and stereotypes, like those about
witchcraft, the need to support older persons taking care of orphans, the need
for the elderly to be able to obtain IT skills, to be able to access public
buildings and be prepared for the ageing experience. In other words, it is a
positive document, as much about an active, engaged old age as it is about the
need for support and assistance. Kenya may be reluctant to commit to ensuring
pension schemes for the retired, though at least it has the limited cash
transfer scheme.  ROLE OF COUNTIES This Bill began in the Senate, and is much about counties as
the national government. Counties do many things that are relevant to the
elderly. Examples are health, housing, physical planning, public road
transport, libraries and recreational facilities. But much of the Bill is concerned with what would be best
described as “social welfare” – particularly care homes for the elderly. But
“social welfare” is not specifically mentioned in the constitution, so, if it
goes beyond housing and health services, it is a matter for the national
government. This is important: the allocation of national revenue to counties
is on the basis of their carrying out their constitutional functions, but not
other functions. And there is another issue. National government institutions
â€• including both the Executive and Parliament â€• are fond of telling counties
what to do. It is true that the national government has the functions of
developing housing and health policies. But policies are supposed to be broad
statement of priorities, not detailed blueprints for county action.  The reasons for having a system of devolution
include allowing counties to develop detailed plans that meet the needs of the
particular county. They even include an element of competition: if some
counties develop strategies that meet the needs of their people, and the people
of other counties see that and push their own government to do likewise, this
is a positive outcome. When the counties and the national government have
overlapping functions, the Constitution tells us that national laws will trump
county ones only if certain conditions are satisfied. The final deciders would
be the courts, but our lawmakers have yet to get to grips with the complexity
of devolution. It is not good enough for the law to say, as this Bill does, that
the national and county governments must do something “to the extent of their
constitutional mandate”. The law must help to clarify what those mandates are.  CONCLUSION The possibility of private members’ Bills in Parliament has
given a fillip to legislators’ interest in the process of making law. That is
no bad thing. But developments requiring government commitment of resources and
personnel really require close cooperation between the executive and the lawmakers.
When we have an existing policy, like that on Older Persons, it is wise for the
law to be based on the policy, as well as on consultation with affected groups. Perhaps such a Bill ought to go further and try to be a full
Charter for the older members of society. How should they be involved, what
measures need to be taken to ensure that, like others, they can participate in
decisions that affect us all, including physical planning and health for
example. How can their rich experience of life be used? How should government
take account of the different circumstances of the elderly in urban and rural
areas? How can incentives be created for families to continue to support,
engage and involve their elderly relatives? How can all this be done
economically? Probably only once in a generation is a law on the rights of the
elderly going to be passed. It should be comprehensive, workable and acceptable
to all.
