Kaimosi Friends University College has been advised to aggressively seek funding from both local and international organisations to build a centre for tropical studies and research. Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology chancellor Peter Muthoka said the centre would help in rainforest conservation efforts and biodiversity. He spoke on Saturday during ‘Chancellor’s Day’ at Kafuko in Vihiga county. He said the institution is well positioned close to the tropical rain forest. Muthoka said academic excellence, research and innovation can only be achieved through provision of world-class standards to students and capacity building for staff. He says that Kafuco was on the track to developing cutting edge experience in the generation, preservation and dissemination of knowledge with a focus on research and innovation. “For this university college to grow to world-class standards, research and innovation should be embraced holistically,” Muthoka said. ‘Stop activism’ He told the university management to ensure the institution aligns its strategic plan to include the government’s development plans in line with Vision 2030 and the UN’s sustainable development goals. Muthoka advised the management to find ways to generate extra revenue through partnerships with universities abroad and the private sector. He told students the culture of activism in universities “is no longer relevant in the 21st Century”. Muthoka urged them to instead use dialogue to resolve differences with the university authority. Principal Ogodo Nandi said the institution was undertaking renovations by rebranding classrooms and lecturers’offices.
