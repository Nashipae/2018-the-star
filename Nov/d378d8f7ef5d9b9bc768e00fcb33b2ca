ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi wants the Kenya Revenue Authority to audit politicians donating millions of shillings to churches. The Nasa principal wants the taxman to establish the source of the money and if the people involved are meeting their tax obligations. Speaking yesterday when he attended a service at Ruaka PCEA, Kiambu county, Mudavadi said the information acquired by KRA will also help in the war on corruption as well as enhance the collection of taxes. In what is seen as a veiled attack on Deputy President William Ruto, who has been donating huge sums in weekly harambees, Mudavadi said some individuals dish out more money than big corporates. “We have people in the country who are donating more funds than Safaricom is giving through its foundation. If he doesn’t have a big company like Safaricom, it is clear that the source of his money is questionable,” Mudavadi said.

The ANC leader said a few selfish individuals have allowed such sectors to go down so they can amass wealth through corruption. Mudavadi urged Kenyans to unite in the fight against corruption so that everyone can have access to good health, education and better roads. “We have seen a lot of development in the fight against corruption and we can win if the people embrace the opposition and work together to ensure good governance,” he said. Mudavadi called on churches to remain the moral compass of society and urged civil society to strengthen its activities by supporting the government and challenging its activities when it goes wrong. Mudavadi said the Auditor General’s reports demonstrated that institutions failed to give good services to Kenyans because of corruption. Read: Nobody can stop me from fundraising - DP Click here for
