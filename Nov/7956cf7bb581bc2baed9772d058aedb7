Immediate former Gor Mahia head coach Dylan Kerr has returned to South Africa after nine years as Black Leopards new coach. Kerr threw in the towel at Gor last week, to seek greener pastures elsewhere and on Monday, he was unveiled as the new tactician for the struggling club which sits 14th in the Premier Soccer League (PLS)  comprising 16 teams. Kerr left Mpumalanga Black Aces, who later changed to Cape Town City FC nine years ago, where he served as an assistant coach and was poached by the Leopards as Joel Masutha’s replacement who resigned last week after series of unwanted results. The Briton’s immediate task will be to stabilise the club which has won twice, drawn thrice and lost six matches in the current season. Kerr joined K’Ogalo last year in July as Jose Ferreira’s replacement, where he steered the club in recapturing the league from Tusker. The former Simba SC coach guided Gor to retaining the league this year and the SportPesa Super Cup which earned them a rematch with English side, Everton. Kerr also won the Super Cup with Gor in January, beating AFC Leopards 1-0 and aided the club to advance to the group stages of the Caf Confederations Cup. Despite the success in the 16 months he had at the club and the good relation with the fans, Kerr mysteriously failed to jet back with the team from the Everton tour on alleged medical grounds and after weeks of speculation, he finally tendered his resignation letter on Thursday last week. Part of the letter stated: “With a very sad heart, I have decided to accept another coaching role for the 2018/19. I want to put on record that I thank you Mr. Chairman for giving me the chance to work with you and more importantly for Gor Mahia FC.” In July, Kerr rejected three coaching offers from Angola, Tanzania and South Africa and in turn dedicated his allegiance to K’Ogalo but four months later he has headed South to Leopards. Black Leopards were founded in 1983 and earned their promotion to the top flight last season.
