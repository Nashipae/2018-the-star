A deaf victim of a bus attack was buried yesterday at Kanjuri village in Mathira, Nyeri county. Dennis Wachira, 36, was stabbed several times when the bus he was travelling in was attacked in Nairobi a week ago. He was the only passenger killed apparently because he could not understadn and comply with the robbers’ demands. Mourners condemned the killing and called for a sensitisation campaign to enable Kenyans understand deaf persons. “There is an urgent need to sensitise people on how to understand deaf people because the communication barrier led to his death,” Susan Thuku, a KBC sign interpreter, said. Thuku said the victims of the incident were robbed of their valuables and no one else died because they understood the attackers’ demands. The deceased’s cousin, John Waweru, said due to his hearing impairment, Wachira could not comply with the attackers’ demands. They robbers then stabbed him several times resulting in his death. In August, the Deaf Empowerment Society of Kenya asked the government to assist the deaf with finances to enable them be financially self-reliant.
