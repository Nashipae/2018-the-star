National Health Insurance Fund CEO Geoffrey Mwangi and acting finance director Wilbert Kurgat were yesterday sent on compulsory leave pending the conclusion of their corruption case. The two have been charged with conspiracy to defeat justice and disobedience of a lawful order in relation to investigations into the loss of Sh2 billion at NHIF. The duo denied the charges on Tuesday and were yesterday released on Sh1 million bond or an alternative bail of Sh500,000. The court directed they deposit their passports. NHIF board chairperson Hannah Muriithi said the besieged officers have been replaced by Nicodemus Odongo and Bernard Njenga respectively. “We assure our stakeholders, our members and partners that NHIF will continue to discharge its mandate and responsibilities without disruption,” Muriithi said in a statement. Odongo was the director of strategy while Njenga was in charge of management accounting. Muriithi said the decision to send Mwangi and Kurgat on compulsory leave was unanimously arrived at by the board. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi yesterday said there were no compelling reasons to deny Mwangi and Kurgat bail. On Tuesday, the DPP asked the court not to release the duo on any bond terms less than Sh50 million. Mwangi and Kurgat were arrested last Friday for refusing to handover documents to the police in relation to the probe. Click here for the latest political news
