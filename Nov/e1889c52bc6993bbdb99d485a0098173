Good Morning. President Uhuru Kenyatta has broken his silence saying that he will have a strong influence on the 2022 polls. Speaking in Nyeri, the President told off those thinking his influence will fade, saying they will be in for a “rude shock”. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this first Friday of November. Showdown looms as Swazuri resumes office A fallout among commissioners and other top officials is threatening to paralyse operations of the National Land Commission. Tension was high yesterday after the High Court allowed chairman Muhammad Swazuri to return to the commission unconditionally. Sources at the commission told the Star yesterday that the court order ‘reinstating’ Swazuri had heightened anxiety as staff are divided by their loyalty to different bosses. _____________________________________________________ Too many arts, not enough science university students Only 16 per cent of university students are pursuing courses that contribute to the Big Four, the Education ministry has said. President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four are universal health care, manufacturing, affordable housing and food security. According to ministry statistics, at least 70 per cent of students are pursuing arts-related courses, while the rest are in science and business-related courses. _____________________________________________________ EACC restrained from valuating and searching Kidero's properties THE Ethics and Anti-corruption commission has been temporarily barred from searching and valuating properties belonging to former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero. Anti-corruption High court Judge Hedwig Ong’undi on Thursday said a ruling touching on the search warrants used by the EACC on Kidero’s properties was not ready thus the need to temporarily stop the commission pending the court’s final decision. Kidero told the court that the anti-graft agency has been invading his properties and causing havoc and distress amongst tenants and occupants of properties he owns. _____________________________________________________ Assembly leadership wrangles divide ODM party top brasses The unending wrangles among ODM MCAs over Nairobi county assembly leadership has escalated the division to the party’s top brasses. ODM chairman John Mbadi and Executive director Oduor Ong’wen are sharply divided over the replacement of the minority leader and chief whip at the assembly. Whereas Mbadi maintains ODM has replaced Kileleshwa MCA Elias Okumu with Highrise MCA Kennedy Oyugi as minority leader and Makongeni’s Peter Imwatok with Lower Savannah’s Nicholas Okumu as whip, Ong’wen has suspended the changes. _____________________________________________________ Hunter becomes prey in Kisii as war on land grabbers heats up About a month ago, 15 anti-graft officers arrested Kisii lands registrar Steve Mokaya and all staff of the lands office on allegations of corruption. Mokaya’s arrest came soon after he rejected 40 letters of grant suspected to have been fraudulently obtained from the High Court in Kisii and presented to his office for title deeds to be issued. Speaking for the first time since his arrest by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission officers, Mokaya told the Star he was a victim of malicious witch-hunt. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
