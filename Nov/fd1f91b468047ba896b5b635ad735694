The Kenya Ports Authority wants a petition challenging its decision to send former MD Cathrine Mturi-Wairi on compulsory leave dismissed. The authority said the petition has been overtaken by events. Through its lawyers, KPA said Mturi-Wairi voluntarily resigned. The lawyers said the former MD had also expressed her wish not to proceed with the petition filed by Mombasa resident Emmanuel Chengo. Chengo wanted the court to reinstate Mturi-Wairi, claiming her dismissal was unfair and illegal. He also sought to stop anyone from taking over the position. The petitioner further wanted the court to declare the dismissal had infringed Mturi-Wairi’s constitutional rights. The authority’s lawyers said Mturi-Wairi was not dismissed, but rather sent on three months compulsory leave. They said Daniel Manduku was appointed in an acting capacity and he was to head the authority for two months. The Attorney General, through Counsel Wachira Guyo, said the issues had already been handled by the Employment court. Guyo said the court had dismissed the petition filed by activist Omkiyah Omtata as it was overtaken by events. Click here for the latest political news
