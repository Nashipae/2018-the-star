A 16-year-old boy hacked his father to death in Malava sub-county on Wednesday following a domestic quarrel. Police arrested the teenager who sat for his KCPE exam this month. He is being held at Malava police station. The two differed when the father, 54, attempted to sell two 2kg tins of maize to raise money to buy illicit alcohol. The deceased's cousin said the boy had beaten his father three times before. “The father had gone to attend rites in the neighbourhood and returned drunk. He wanted to pick maize to sell, but the son resisted. When he insisted on going away with the maize, the suspect picked a panga and slashed him to death,” he said. He fled but was later arrested. Under Luhya customs, a person who kills a family member is disowned and has to seek refuge at his maternal uncles' homes. The slain person’s body is normally buried at night after carrying out a series of rites, including burning the house of the suspect. "We are not happy and we would have killed him if we found him before the police did," the cousin said. Kimang’eti assistant chief Joseph Juma asked parents to counsel their children to respect the elderly. Click here for the latest Political news
