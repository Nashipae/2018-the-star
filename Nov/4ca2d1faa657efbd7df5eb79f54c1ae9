Nairobi MCAs are seeking clarity on illegal clinics in the city following the recent expose of James Mugo alias Mugo wa Wairimu. On Wednesday, chair of the Nairobi County Assembly Women Caucus Doris Kanario requested for a statement on the number of clinics operating without licences in the city. “I wish to request a statement from the chairperson of the sectoral committee on Health services regarding the alleged operation of illegal clinics in the county, specifically the recent case of Dr James Mugo alias Mugo wa Wairimu,” Kanario said. She said the “quack” doctor has been operating illegal clinics a in Githurai 44 and Kayole areas, posing a big risk to unsuspecting patients. Kanario also pointed out that it was claimed county officers went to inspect the clinics but were denied entry. “It is worrying how a quack doctor could be operating so many unlicensed clinics in the country despite complaints from members of the public on the illegal dealings in the said clinics which include conducting abortions, rape of patients among others,” Kanario said. She said the response should highlight why the executive has allowed quack Wairimu to operate a clinic and a list of all licensed clinics in the county. The response should also include measures the executive has put in place to ensure no illegal clinics are operating in the county. Majority leader Abdi Guyo said that the matter was weighty and the house should be take it seriously, especially the committee involved.
