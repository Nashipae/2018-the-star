Nominated MP David Sankok has told Sports Cabinet Secretary Richard Echesa to pay the Kenya amputees football team allowances of Sh2.3 million or be impeached. Sankok said it was shameful for the amputee team, who participated in the World Cup competition, to spend a night at the Sports ministry boardroom while waiting for their allowances on Thursday. Speaking to the Star in Narok town on Saturday, Sankok said sports officials involved in the mistreatment of the team should be punished.

Sankok told the CS that if he will not have paid the team their allowances in full by this week, then he will table the matter in Parliament.
