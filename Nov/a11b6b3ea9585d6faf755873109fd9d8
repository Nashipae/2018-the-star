Mathioya MP Peter Kimari has said the gender Bill is one of the issues that should be reviewed in the proposed referendum. Kimari has said he will support the Bill on Wednesday but with a heavy heart as he believes no free seats should be given out as the country struggles to reduce its wage bill. The MP said a lot of funds and time have been committed to empowerment of the girl child over the years which he said has increased the number of women in leadership. “We have tried hard to nurture the girl child and make it possible for women to prosper but as the President told us, we will support the Bill,” the MP said.
