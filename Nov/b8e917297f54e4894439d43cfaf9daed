Narok county and religious leaders have partnered to end the teen pregnancy crisis. Governor Samuel Tunai yesterday said they will find lasting solutions so girls can go to school without interruptions. “We want to impart values to young people to eradicate challenges of teenage pregnancies, early marriages and FGM,” he said during a fundraiser at Mulot Catholic Church. Tunai said they will not sit back and watch girls drop out of school because of avoidable issues. “We need to establish alternative education progammes for all, especially during holidays when the vices are common,” he said. Also present were MPs Ken Kiloku (Narok East), Samuel Kositany (Ilmotiok) and Patrick Sosio (Shankoe).
