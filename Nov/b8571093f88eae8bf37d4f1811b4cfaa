STARRING: Tiffany Haddish, Tika Sumpter, Omari Hardwick, Mehcad Brooks, Amber Riley, Whoopi Goldberg RELEASE DATE: November 2  When Whoopi Goldberg leaves her comfortable seat at The View to make a movie, it sure as hell better be a good one. I mean, the woman is one of the only few living EGOT winners, for God’s sake. But in this case, Sister Mary Clarence (Sister Act) should have stayed put in her moderator chair at ABC’s The View. When Tanya is released from prison, she moves in with her sister Danica. Tanya’s wild personality is not easy to live with. When Tanya finds out the man her sister has been dating online is catfishing her, she vows to make him pay. This doesn’t sit well with Danica. In denial, Danica kicks Tanya out. Tanya tries to move in with their weed-loving mother. After much hype and publicity, the film is, at best, basic with a tinge of funny. There’s not much to report on, in terms of plot. The film aims (and fails) to be a crowd pleaser in the moment. The cast, however, do the best they can to salvage the mess that is the script of Nobody’s Fool. Tyler Perry is respected enough to have such a huge ensemble of actors to work for him. But his overambition in making a long, complicated film in 10 days is the whole reason the film lacks finesse.  He confesses to writing the story around Tiffany Haddish, which is great. But Tiffany’s is (with all due respect) a one-trick pony. She knows how to play one role well: the wild card. In his concentration of perfecting the wild card, Perry missed great chances of letting the other cast members shine. The movie ended up feeling like one long episode of The Tiffany Haddish show, with cameo appearances from other great actors.  Star Rating: 2/5
