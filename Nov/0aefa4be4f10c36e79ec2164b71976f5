Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu’s domestic worker Cosmas Mutua, got a reprieve yesterday after escaping a custodial sentence for lying to police. Mutua got his freedom yesterday after spending eight days in custody. He was arrested on Saturday last week and charged on Monday when he admitted lying to police by reporting a false kidnap. Senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku said after reviewing the probation report on Mutua, she considers a non custodial sentence will be appropriate. Mutua had reported to police officer Wesley Sigei that he had been kidnapped by a motorcycle gang. He falsely alleged that the gang insulted him and asked for directions to Mwilu's home before driving away with him. DCI traced his mobile phone’s movement and established that he was not at the places he claimed to have been and he agreed before the court that he lied. He had pleaded guilty and asked for leniency through lawyer Robert Mwangale. Click here for the latest political news
