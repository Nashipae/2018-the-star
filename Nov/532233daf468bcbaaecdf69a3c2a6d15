Kinangop deputy county commissioner Daniel Nyameti has dismissed claims that the State has withdrawn the security of freedom fighter Dedan Kimathi's widow Mukami Kimathi. He said on Thursday that the granny's security is guaranteed and can never be compromised. "She is allocated two armed security officers who are always at her disposal," he said. Mukami's daughter Evelyne Kimathi on Wednesday protested that her mother's security both in Nairobi and her Njabini home in Kinangop were withdrawn under unclear circumstances. Nyameti said the government is not aware of any security issue concerning Mukami. He said anybody stating otherwise is spreading rumours. He, however, did not speak about Mukami’s driver who the family claimed was disarmed and withdrawn a year ago. Evelyne earlier said Mukami's driver was first disarmed and then asked to abandon the post about a year ago under unclear circumstances. She claimed two of Mukami’s other aides were withdrawn a week ago. "We are wondering what wrong we have committed to warrant this."
