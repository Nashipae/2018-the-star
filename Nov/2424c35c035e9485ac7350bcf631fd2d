Retired justice Philip Ransley was arrested in London in July over charges of fraud in Kenya. He was granted bail and his extradition hearing will be in December (see P9). The High Court ordered Ransley’s arrest in January 2017. It took 18 months for the government to deliver the arrest warrant to the UK. Within weeks the UK arrested Ransley. That delay was partly due to turf wars between the DPP and the Attorney General but Ransley also had powerful friends who wanted to halt his extradition. Kenya has a history of dragging its feet over extradition. In 2011 Jersey requested the extradition of Samuel Gichuru and Chris Okemo for money laundering. In 2015 the ICC issued arrest warrants against Paul Gicheru and Philip Bett for witness tampering. They are all still in Kenya. In 2014 the UK courts convicted British businessmen of bribing Kenyan election officials who still remain free. Sometimes it seems that foreign powers are keener on bringing Kenyan criminals to justice than Kenya.  Quote of the day: "Life is like a game of cards.
