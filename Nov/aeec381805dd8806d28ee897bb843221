The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority wants state tenders linked to the Kenya Revenue Authority’s e-tax system to enhance accountability and fight corruption. Chairman Andrew Musangi said this should form part of the reforms under the electronic procurement system. In 2014, National Treasury launched the e-procurement system to enhance management of public finances and tendering process through the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). The system was also set to manage huge price variations of commonly used items in ministries, state departments and agencies. “The e-procurement has been considered as a stand-alone structure. PPRA will ensure that all entities are tied to the KRA and avoid ghost tendering. There is no logical reason to object,” Musangi said at the East African Procurement Forum in Nairobi. In July, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed all public organisations to publish information of contractors, their directors and number of contracts awarded by 15th to promote transparency in award of state tenders. The information should be publicised through their websites, the e-Citizen portal, the PPRA platforms, public notice boards and any other official government publications. PPRA director general Maurice Juma said the state is in the final stage of implementing the system and only 50 per cent of government agencies have complied. “PPRA will present a report to the treasury in December on how the entities have been monitoring the usage of the portal as we ensure full compliance,” Juma said.
