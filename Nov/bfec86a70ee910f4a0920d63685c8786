The Hindu Diwali celebrations will be held today. Fireworks are expected in urban centres around 7 pm to commemorate the festivals. Hindu Council of Kenya, speaking to the Star on phone, said all temples and halls are going to be brightly illuminated. Kamal Gupta, chairman of the Council hopes the celebrations will lead to peace and harmony in the country. "May this Diwali bring you the utmost in peace and prosperity, may lights triumph over darkness, peace transcend the earth and the spirit of light illuminate the world," Gupta said on Wednesday. CS John Munyes in a statement on Tuesday said the fireworks should only be used at authorised venues like schools, hotels, temples, sports grounds and school compounds. "The displays are held between 1900hours and 2300hrs only during the authorised dates," Munyes said. Fireworks dealers have been cautioned against selling to children under the age of thirteen years “Aerial display fireworks (shells, roman candle and cakes) are only sold to holders of permits to display fireworks duly signed by an Inspector of Explosives,” Munyes said. Diwali is an international Hindu festival of lights celebrated in October or November. It symbolises the spiritual "victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance."
