A court has allowed Citizen TV journalist Jacque Maribe to access her house in Lang'ata. The house was locked for investigations into the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani. Maribe on Monday sued the Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji for contempt following the blockade. The High court on Tuesday ordered the DCI and DPP to allow the journalist access her house. The journalist was charged with Kimani's murder alongside her then fiance Joseph Irungu alias Jowie. Justice James Wakiaga on Tuesday directed the prosecution to honour earlier orders issued on the same. Maribe's lawyer Katwa Kigen said Haji should be held liable for breaching court orders. He also sought that prosecutor Catherine Mwaniki be jailed. Maribe has also put a fight in court to have the investigative agencies release her car and cell phone. In her application, she says she has to borrow clothes, crush in other people's houses for accomodation. The court rejected her bid to repossess her phone on grounds it is being used as an exhibit. Her application for contempt will be heard on February 28, 2019. Read: JowieÂ withdraws 'woman eater' case against Judge Wakiaga Click here for the latest political news
