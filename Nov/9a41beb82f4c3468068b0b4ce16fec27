Baringo governor Stanley Kiptis has said he will pack up and leave office if he fails to deliver by 2022. “If by 2022 I will not have worked satisfactorily, then I will be more than ready to leave office and hand over to another person,” he said. Kiptis, who took over from Benjamin Cheboi, spoke to residents of Sachangwan, Kiptuno, Kewangoi, Kiptuno villages in Eldama Ravine subcounty on Tuesday. He attributed the slow pace of development in the county to familiarisation with his office. “I’m yet to settle in office, but cartels are already determined to bring me down,” Kiptis said. He said he has been in office only for one year and Baringo residents should give him more time to streamline his office. Kiptis told critics to correct and advise him on the way forward instead of using the social media to condemn him.
