Police have seized 1,690 vehicles in the crackdown on traffic offenders. Central regional coordinator Wilson Njega said on Friday that 451 motorcycles had been seized and 3,481 individuals nabbed and charged. They included private car users who did not fasten their safety belts and boda riders bodas with two or more passengers. Njega said the operation will continue until they get rid of unroadworthy vehicles and ensure strict compliance with traffic rules. "We also want to remove criminal gangs from matatu stages. They idle and extort money, purporting to authorise people to use certain routes,"Â he said. Two drivers allegedly attempting to bribe police officers on the Nyeri-Othaya road were nabbed and taken to court. The regional coordinator said many lives are lost during festive seasons through drink driving, speeding and reckless driving. "All PSVs should have functioning speed governors, alid inspection and insurance certificates and be in good condition. Riders should carry only one passenger and both have helmets and reflectors."
