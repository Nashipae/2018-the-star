Former Embakasi South MP Irshad Sumra has said he was behind a video recording that led to the arrest of a city MCA for allegedly demanding Sh5.7 million. Sumra yesterday told the Nairobi county assembly’s Powers and Privileges committee he advised Rahim Chatur, owner of the Concord Hotel in Westlands, to record Parklands ward representative Jayendra Malde when he went to pick the bribe. He said Chatur had sought his advice in order to stop City Hall from demolishing Concord Hotel for sitting on riparian land. “I’m the one who organised the recording through Chatur, because I was not there when they met,” Sumra told the committee. Malde was arrested by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives on August 25, on suspicion he attempted to extort money from Chatur’s family, which is accused of grabbing public land in Gigiri. An EACC officer arrested Malde when he showed up to collect the Sh5.7 million.

The commission released Malde on bail. He was not charged over the allegations. Chatur denied giving Malde money. “Yes it’s is true that I learnt of his arrest through social media. It is also true that I did not give out the money, everything was handled by Sumra,” he said. Malde told the Star his integrity is intact and he did not take any money. "It is a fake allegation and it is denting my name throughout the country. This matter is serious because my family was traumatised," Malde said. Click here for the latest political news
