Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has been given seven days to name cartels behind illegal maize importation or be impeached. Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter yesterday said Kiunjuri has failed to rein in unscrupulous traders whom he said have taken over management of departments in the ministry. The MP asked the minister to resign. “Why is he still in office? He is not telling us who are these cartels. He even doesn’t know the exact amount of maize that has gone bad. We will impeach him,” Keter said. He was addressing a press conference at Parliament Buildings.
