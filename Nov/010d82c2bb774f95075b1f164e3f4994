ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru has directed the Communication Authority to filter pornographic sites to help protect children. Mucheru on Thursday said the increased access to the sites by young people has largely contributed to early pregnancies. "Our children are our future. Let's close the sites first, then have a debate on when to open them," Mucheru said. He spoke at the CIO 100 symposium at Naivasha. KNEC Chairman George Magoha had on Wednesday said the ICT sector is partly to blame for the increased ease of access of pornographic sites in the country. Magoha said the pregnancy crisis witnessed in the country is due to the fact that some of the young girls access some of these sites.
