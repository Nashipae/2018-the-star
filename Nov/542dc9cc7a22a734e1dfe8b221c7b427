Muslims for Human Rights rapid response officer Francis Auma has been released unconditionally just moments after he was arrested in Mombasa. Auma had been arrested in Changamwe over an alleged traffic offence. He said eight traffic policemen pounced on him. He was however not charged. "If I had committed an offence as claimed, why did they not charge me? Is it a trap to set me up?" Auma said. He said he fears for his life, adding that the arrest is linked to the death of tout Caleb Espino at Changamwe police cells on September 18. Police have been accused of killing him, a claim they denied. Changamwe police boss Peter Omwana said Auma was not arrested because of Espino's death.
