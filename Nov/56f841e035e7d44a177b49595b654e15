Family and friends of actor Kone Nouhoum will today meet at All Saints Cathedral to fundraise for his hospital bill. He is admitted at Nairobi Hospital's Intensive Care Unit, following a car accident near Naivasha that left him critically injured. Through social media, celebrities have been campaigning for his funds. Fellow actor Pascal Tokodi said a fundraiser is set to be held today. “His bills are piling up and it's getting heavy for the family every single day. If you're available on the 8th, please come through to the All Saints Cathedral,” he wrote. Nyashinski wrote: "Please find it in your heart to send whatever you can. This is extremely heartbreaking. Let’s come together and give overwhelming support for Kone and his young family." Kone has featured on several local productions, among them Mama Duka, Mali, New Beginnings and Selina.
