Kisii residents have been urged to embrace court annexed mediation to resolve disputes. Governor James Ongwae spoke on Tuesday when High Court judges William Musyoka and David Majanja paid him a courtesy call. Musyoka is leading a team planning the launch of court annexed mediation in Kisii county. Court annex mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process conducted under the umbrella of the court where parties handle their disputes with the assistance of a third party - a mediator. "Our people should embrace this alternative dispute resolution mechanism, which is a less expensive and quicker way of solving disputes while creating harmony in the community. We shall support this initiative by the Judiciary to ease the backlog of cases in court,” Ongwae said. There are about 400 disputes in court in Kisii with some arising from lack of clarity on assets and liabilities inherited from former local authorities, he said. "Arbitration is the new dimension to dispute resolution, the world over as it saves time,” deputy governor Joash Maangi said. Click here for the latest political news
