Acting Nairobi county secretary Pauline Kahiga has been put on the spot over her competence after she skipped an assembly meeting. The county’s Assembly Budget and Appropriations Committee was last Wednesday forced to adjourn their sitting meant to deliberate on the Finance Bill 2018 after Kahiga failed to show up. Kahiga later turned up at City Hall on Thursday, to the committee’s displeasure who took offense with her earlier snub and lack of apology. Minority Chief Whip Peter Imwatok said he might go ahead and marshal the support of MCAs to start the process of officially removing her from office. “When someone fails to appear before a committee after being summoned, one must have a written permission from the governor, which you do not have. I’m disappointed by the executive you are leading and you are a failure as their leader,” Imwatok said. Through an earlier letter to the committee, Kahiga said the county executives wouldn’t be able to attend the meeting because they were invited on short notice. The committee led by chairman Robert Mbatia said Kahiga showed arrogance towards the assembly and questioned her competence. Kahiga was further requested to bring her credentials, job description and terms of services in the next sitting, in order for the committee to determine if she was competent enough to be in office.
