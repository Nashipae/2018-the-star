Online forex trading specialists are pushing for the currency trade despite Capital Markets Authority warning against unlicenced brokers. The automated forex trading is currently gaining recognition in the country with many participants terming it as good moneymaking venture. Forex Trading strategist and Director Nairobi School of Forex Eugene Abungana said online forex trading offers opportunity for participants in the country and there need for people to be conversant with the trading strategies. “There is a lot of mis-information around forex trading being termed as illegal and a gamble. Online forex trading is like any other business and we are encouraging people trade with local trading platforms,” Abungana said. Last week, CMA warned Kenyans against online foreign exchange trading through unlicensed entities, saying they risked losing their investments. The authority has only licenced global equity investor EGM securities as the only non-dealing broker, providing the market with exposure to global macro opportunities such as foreign exchange, oil, gold and other precious metals and commodities. The online forex market in Kenya is however concentrated to buying and selling of currencies, with Abungana estimating daily volumes at Sh34.5 million ($350,000 million) in the offshore trading platforms. He also estimated the number of retail or individual traders to be over 100,000. EGM Securities chief executive, Kevin Ng’ang’a said research on trading activities in the now locally regulated environment will increase their entrepreneurial skills and lower risks. “Participants need to employ trading strategies including interest rate hike analysis and past market trends,” he said.
