Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong'o is the best performing city county chief according to latest polls by research firm Trends and Insights for Africa (Tifa). Compared to his Nairobi, Mombasa and Kiambu counterparts Mike Sonko, Hassan Joho and Ferdinand Waititu, Nyong'o emerged the best in the county citizen score card with 59 per cent. This is an improvement from the last survey conducted in May when he scored 56 per cent (C+). According to the results released on Wednesday, Nyongo's performance is attributed to the county's cleanliness taking lead followed by feeder roads. He was followed by Kiambu's Waititu at 53 per cent, an equivalent of C plain, while Nairobi and Mombasa scored 51 per cent each. The polls shows that Sonko is the most improved governor in terms of performance having scored a D+ in the last survey. Street lighting and garbage collection took the lead. 77 per cent of city residents want Sonko to operate from the city with 58 per cent saying he should be impeached if he doesn't relocate to Nairobi.
