The handshake has been mistaken as a licence to steal public funds, ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi (pictured) said yesterday. Mudavadi said even though the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga brought tranquility, it has gagged Opposition MPs from pointing out the ills in government. Speaking in Mombasa, Mudavadi said corruption has become rampant in the National Assembly to an extent that reports are being doctored. He said MPs have neglected their oversight role. He cited the debates on contraband sugar and illegal maize imports whose outcomes were marred with bribery allegations. “Parliament has gone to bed with the Executive and abandoned its sacred function of keeping the government in check. Parliament reports are either altered or diluted and mutilated to protect partisan interests and not those of the public,” Mudavadi said.
