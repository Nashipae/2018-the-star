North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood (pictured) has dismissed claims that he illegally acquired public land in Meru. He said he bought the land, which is opposite the Kenya Methodist University, from a clan. “The plot belonged to the former MP Harvester Angaine and Gatukune clan which was subdivided in 1974 yielding 15 plots. In 1985, there arose an ownership dispute but a court in 2001 ruled in favour of the clan. Title deeds were then issued. I bought two plots,” he said.
