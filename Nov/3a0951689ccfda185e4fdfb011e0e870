Former Auntie Boss actress Nyce Wanjeri’s husband Titus has cleared the air on a post he put on social media, and later deleted, saying his marriage was over. “What I had said was past tense. It’s best I sort of know exactly what is happening. I can’t conclude now. Everything has its ups and downs and I think it’s too soon to decide or know what is happening,” Tito told Word Is. In the post Tito, a musician, said their marriage suffered because his wife (Shiro) had become an absentee. According to the post, things have not been working following Nyce’s success on TV. “Why am I using Facebook? My marriage is over. So painful I swear. I saw it coming though. Success causes absenteeism, lack of bonding and lack of family time. Why did I imagine we last forever? We are both artists. It’s not normal. It doesn’t work,” Titus posted on Facebook. Asked if the two are still a item, Tito said; “It is better we take time to figure out what is up. Ask yourself why the post is no longer there.” But have they sorted out the issue? “Let’s say yes...At times not everything works. We have our ups and downs, which is normal. I may have acted out of the feelings I [had] at that time but it’s something we are handling.” Calls and messages to Nyce went unanswered.
