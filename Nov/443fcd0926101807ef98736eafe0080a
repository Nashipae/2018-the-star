Two prominent opposition politicians from the Democratic Republic of Congo have said they are teaming up to challenge for the presidency in next month's elections. Felix Tshisekedi - the son of Etienne Tshisekedi, who died last year after spending decades in opposition - will be a presidential candidate with Vital Kamerhe as his running mate. The two men, who made the announcement in Kenya, had previously agreed to back a unity candidate, Martin Fayulu, in an effort to defeat the man chosen by the governing party, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadari. Analysts say the opposition's failure to stick with one candidate is likely to play into the hands of the governing party. Long-delayed elections are scheduled to take place in DR Congo on 23 December when President Joseph Kabila, in power for 18 years, will step down. Click here for the latest political news
