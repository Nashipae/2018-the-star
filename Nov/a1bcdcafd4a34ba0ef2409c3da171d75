Girls in Moyale have been asked to set realistic goals to achieve their ambitions in life. Marsabit governor Mohamud Ali said everything is possible for girls in the county if only they put their heart to it. He spoke on Saturday while addressing more than 300 youths. Ali encouraged young people to form groups so as to be awarded tenders by both the government and non-governmental organisations. The governor said his administration will come up a policy to ensure the youth are not left out. He said the county government offers free polytechnic education so that more youth acquire skills. The governor's wife Alamitu Jattani stressed that girls should strive to adapt vocational education as a way of making them self-reliant. She added that lack of self-confidence is one of the factors that stopped girls from joining vocational fields. "Remember that your dream can be achieved if you strive for it," Alamitu said. Moyale MP Qalich Gufu said the CDF office is collecting data for students in colleges and universities so that eligible learners are allocated bursaries. Click here for the latest political news
