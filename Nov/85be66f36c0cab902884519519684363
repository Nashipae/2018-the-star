Two suspects have been arrested at Sankuri farm in Garissa subcounty in connection with the murder of a night guard on Saturday. Speaking to the Star on phone, county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng said the guard was killed outside Rafiki hardware as he conducted his Al-fajir prayers. Chepchieng said the two, Daniel Makau and Kimwele Musembi, entered the store by breaking the grills, but were unable to break into the safe that had an unspecified amount of money. Chepchieng said police tracked the suspects using a phone they stole from the hardware. An officer said the surveillance camera at the store helped to identify their faces. The two will be arraigned in court today to face murder charges.
