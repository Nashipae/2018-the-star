Anxiety has gripped Wajir county following numerous arrests of county officials over corruption and abuse of office. The latest arrest came on Saturday when the EACC detectives nabbed two Wajir county officials over alleged embezzlement of Sh26.1 million Wajir county secretary Ahmed Sahal and Jeff Mworia Githinji, head of Treasury and economic adviser to the governor, were arrested in Nairobi and Wajir towns respectively. Siyad Ibrahim was arrested last week for clearing cheques that did not bear the necessary signatures. Finance executive Daud Abdullahi, who is still at large, has been ordered to surrender himself. The county secretary was rounded up alongside Jeff Mworia, head of Treasury and Economic Adviser to the governor. EACC, in a tweet, said the two suspects are being investigated on allegations of embezzlement of Sh26.1 million at Wajir county. “Investigations by EACC established that Wajir county government officials, in cahoots with KCB Bank officials, irregularly withdrew and embezzled Sh26.1 million held at the county government imprest account.” A source privy to the investigations said the county secretary is also being probed for over-recruiting staff in May, June and July among other charges.
