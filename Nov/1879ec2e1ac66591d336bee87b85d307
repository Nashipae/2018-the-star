The Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board has banned Marie Stopes from conducting abortions in Kenya. The board, citing complaints from members of the public, also blocked the health service provider from publishing misleading information on its website. Marie Stopes has been the stop for many who seek to undo unplanned pregnancies. The Constitution has legalised the practice, albeit with a rider that it can only be performed on mothers endangered by a pregnancy. But the board, in a meeting on November 10, said it was dissatisfied by the facility's guidelines on reproductive health. It ordered Marie Stopes to submit, within 60 days, a report of the reviewed guidelines "to conform with the law." The Committee led by Daniel Yumbya further ordered the hospital to submit weekly returns to the regulator over the next 60 days. The regulator also barred the provider from running advertisements that contravene Public Health Facilities Advertising Rules, 2016.
