The prosecution had argued that they would interfere with investigations and witnesses if released on bail. The lawyers of the accused - Aggrey Mwamu, Opondo Kaluma and TJ Kajwang - argued that bail is a constitutional right. Kaluma told the judge their clients were state officers who should be allowed to serve. Ochieng later agreed to their demand after directing the lawyers and the prosecution to come up with conditions that will apply after the release. In his ruling, he stated that the accused will cease commenting on the matter and not make contact with witnesses. He also warned the accused that should they break any of the conditions, then the bail will be cancelled. The case will be mentioned on January 23. Click here for the latest political news
