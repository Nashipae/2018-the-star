Murang’a tea farmers want the DCI to probe significant drop in their annual bonuses. Kanyenya-ini Factory payments declined from last year’s Sh1.1 billion to Sh865 million. Farmers want action taken. They got Sh37 per kilogramme — Sh11 less than last year. They questioned why their cash declined, yet the Kenya Tea Development Agency had announced last month that countrywide payments would increase by 9.4 per cent — from Sh57 billion to Sh85 billion. Last month, they petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta, DP William Ruto and Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri to intervene before the payments were released. On Saturday, farmer Peter Kihungi said they received no response. He called for swift action to prevent what befell the coffee sector. Corruption in tea factories could ruin the Big Four, he said. “The coffee sector collapsed because farmers anticipated high payments and took enormous loans but were unable to service them after the global coffee market dwindled, leaving cooperative societies in deep debts,” he said.
