The first county governments experienced many challenges in navigating the transition from civic authorities to the new devolved system. Inexperienced but high-handed governors assumed their offices and immediately embarked on jettisoning anything that resembled the previous local authorities — despised as lowly in many instances — and embellishing their positions with new trappings of power. They soon ran afoul of equally ebullient and boisterous Members of County Assemblies eager to assert themselves as a grade above the ordinary ‘councilor’. The clash of egos resulted in upheavals in counties as assemblies attempted to impeach governors. It is still too early to predict what the second crop of county governments will look like but early signs indicate the target has shifted from governors to speakers of county assemblies who are having a nightmare managing the multifarious demands of MCAs. Speakers of Nairobi, Kisumu, Kakamega, Kirinyaga and Homa Bay counties have either been removed or are hanging on precariously as anarchy spreads across the counties. The chaos that has attended the impeachments makes the speaker’s job one of the most dangerous in the republic. Speakers are at the mercy of MCAs who have turned assemblies into arenas for prosecuting unreasonable demands. It is time the Senate intervened to set the rules for engagement among speakers, governors and assemblies to protect devolution from partisan politics.  Quote of the Day: “Discipline is the soul of an army. It makes small numbers formidable; procures success to the weak, and esteem to all.”   George Washington, The US General, later 1st President, bade farewell to his army after the Revolutionary War on November 2, 1783.
