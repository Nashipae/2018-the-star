Amani Gracious, the girl from Githurai who became an instant sensation after singing Alicia Keys' song Girl On Fire, is set to release an EP. Known to many as Amani G, she seems to be making great moves after releasing three gospel songs in five months. "The EP is called '13', and it is based on my 13 years since I was born, and of course the five months that have changed my life," Amani told Word Is. Guest artistes during the December 2 launch will be gospel singer Daddy Owen, Moji Short Baba, Timeless Noel and Pitson. Amani credits her father, who is also a musician, for her talent. "My dad inspired me so much in music even before I became a superstar. Seeing him struggle out there to earn from his music gives me courage to work harder at this young age," she said. "He is getting old and I will be the one to fill his gap." The father is her mentor and is training her to be relevant in the industry. "I have to understand what the industry entails, and I would like to take after him. I know he will mentor me so well and even how to manage myself," Amani said. "There is a time I will be alone and that is what I want to learn from him now. My mum will not be there all through my life to monitor me. No, there will be a time she will be doing her own things because I will be mature. So that is why I am using this opportunity to learn from my dad how to manage my money as an artiste." Amani is looking forward to working with gospel artiste Size 8, who also encourages her in the industry. "Size 8 has also been my mentor, although I have not met her. The way she was before turning to gospel is very different to who she has turned out to be now," she said. "She was different, now you see her down on her knees, praying, and that is who I want to be. I want to be interceding for people. She was very naughty in her music, but God has changed her. I would also like to be a more godly person and to never part from His ways."
