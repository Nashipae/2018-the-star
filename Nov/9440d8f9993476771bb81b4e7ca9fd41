An Eldoret court has issued an arest warrant against a son of controversial politician Jackson Kibor ­ — who had tried to drive off trespassers with his vehicle mounted with spikes. Chief Magistrate Charles Obulutsa ordered police to arrest Ezekiel Libor for failing to appear in court for trespassing on his father’s land. Kibor sued three of his sons including Ezekiel for cultivating his 2,000 acres at Kabenes in Uasin Gishu county without his permission. The others are Elkana and Raymond. “I order the OCS for Eldoret Police station to effect the arrest warrant against Ezekiel Libor,” Obulutsa said. Ezekiel is Kibor’s third-born son with his third wife Naomi Cheptoo. Kibor is suing her for divorce. The hearing of the divorce case started before the magistrate where Kibor testified how his sons illegally invaded his farm and started ploughing it without his knowledge or authority. The incident occurred on December 27 last year. “They were armed with machetes and clubs and invaded my land which they took over forcefully,” Kibor said. He added that he was away at the time that his sons issued death threats against workers they found on the farm. The workers called Kibor to the farm where there was a brief confrontation between him and his sons. “I quickly drove to the farm in my car mounted with sharp spikes in a bid to chase them away. It’s my land and they had no right to use it in any way,” Libor said. The politician said his sons were invaders. “If they come back again I will face them again because the land is mine and I am the only one who can allow them to use it,” he said. Kibor said he had not allocated any part of the land to either of his sons. He accused his sons of even going ahead to lease part of the land to neighbours. But the two sons present accused Kibor of lying to the court.
