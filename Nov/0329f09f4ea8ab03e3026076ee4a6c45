The Rongo magistrate court on Friday sentenced a man to 20 years in jail after he was found guilty of defiling his 15-year-old epileptic niece. John Omollo Sodo was found guilty of committing the crime in Awendo subcounty. Rongo principal magistrate Raymond Langat said the court found the suspect guilty of committing the crime on July 20. The court heard that the accused was the custodian of the minor and intentionally and unlawfully defiled her. In the alternative count, the accused person was charged with the offence of committing an indecent act with a child. The court heard that the accused unsuccessfully tried to persuade the minor before dragging her to a nearby bush and committing the act. Langâ€™at said that after carefully considering all the evidence on record and having been guided by the relevant principles of law, from all the witnesses, he found the man guilty. He said that it would be a lesson to the rest of the people coming from the areas of Awendo and Rongo where cases of defilement have been on the increase.
