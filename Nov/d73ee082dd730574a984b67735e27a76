Homeowners of Seefar Apartments have now petitioned the National Assembly over the impending demolition. In the petition presented by Lang'ata MP Nixon Korir states that it is not fair to determine the fate of more than 1,000 people on the basis of visual inspections without any verifiable scientific measurement. The property that has 288 apartments was constructed by Erdemann Property Limited in 2011 and is located along Mbagathi Road.

Members of Parliament have said housing is a key pillar in the Jubilee government's Big Four agenda, and demolition of the apartments will be a major setback. Homeowners said the notice of demolition is vague, ambiguous and an afterthought. They say out of the buildings constructed near the dam, it is only Seefar Apartments that is purported to be within riparian reserve.
