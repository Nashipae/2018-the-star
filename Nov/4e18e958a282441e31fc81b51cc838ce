Two suspects linked to the murder of DP William Ruto’s Director of Communication Emmanuel Tallam's father failed to take a plea on Wednesday. Silas Too and Hillary Korir were arraigned at the Eldoret High Court but did not have a lawyer to represent them. They face the charge of murdering 85-year-old Benjamin Koech on April 14. The latter was a prominent businessman in Nandi Hills town. The elderly man's body was found dumped in River Kipsigei. The incident occurred at Cheptingting village, Lessos, Nandi county. Justice Stephen Githinji directed the prosecution to find a lawyer for the suspects so that they can be brought back to court for plea taking. "I direct that the matter be mentioned on November 13 before this court," Justice Githinji said. Police say the accused jointly with others not before the court attacked the elderly man as he was heading home. Mzee Koech was reported as missing before his body was discovered two days later. A postmortem revealed he was hit with a blunt object. "Investigations indicated that the elderly man was killed elsewhere and his body dumped in the river to create an impression that he drowned," DCI report states. The case has been under investigations for over five months. Click here for the latest political news
