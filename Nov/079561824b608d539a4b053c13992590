Senators are today expected to vote on a report on the controversial Ruaraka land that has implicated top government officials. The report prepared by the county Public Accounts and Investment Committee wants Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and Education PS Belio Kipsang held responsible for the controversial land saga. The senators are expected to either reject or adopt the report after the House debated it last week where the majority of the legislators calling for action to be taken against the senior government officials for the irregular payment of Sh1.5 billion in the land deal.

Murkomen held that while Parliament had the mandate to do inquiries on such issues, it does not have prosecutorial powers or the power to investigate the crime for purposes of charging anybody. He said it was only EACC and DCI that can find one culpable and not House committees. "The duty of our House is to inquire and to provide information that will be used by the institution of the Director of Public Prosecution, who cannot be directed not even by us, to do proper investigations that will find criminal culpability of any individual," he said.
