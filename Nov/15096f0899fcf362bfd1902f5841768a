Kenya will negotiate with 35 partner states for new air navigation spaces when the International Civil Aviation Organization comes to Nairobi next month. Kenya Civil Aviation Authority director general Captain Gilbert Kibe said the event will save the country time and money spent in making the trips. “Normally, a partner state has to visit another state to negotiate on new air services, place rules or amendments. “This will improve the consensus made on practices to support efficient safe and economically sustainable sector,” Kibe said. The KCAA signed a training agreement with US Federal Aviation Administration on October 26 to have flight safetyinspector courses provided at the East African School of Aviation in Nairobi. The agreement makes EASA a training venue for FAA in the Africa region. This agreement comes after the country was granted International Aviation Safety Assessment Category 1 in early 2017 by FAA, providing the basis for the current US-Kenya direct flights. Transport CS James Macharia said the event would provide and opportunity for integration into a global air transport network.
