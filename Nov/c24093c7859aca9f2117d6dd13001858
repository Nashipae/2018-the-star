Fresh money wars have erupted in Nasa after two partner parties withdrew financial support. The two have directed that members’ contributions be channelled to their individual party coffers. As per the coalition agreement, all Nasa affiliate MPs were to contribute Sh10,000 per month to the outfit. A similar amount was being wired to the respective parties’ accounts. Cumulatively, Nasa was receiving Sh1,520,000 every month from MPs’ subscriptions. This translates to Sh18,240,000 in a year.

As a party, we didn’t feel the accountability aspect of the Nasa secretariat on how the money was being used,” Wiper executive director Jared Siso said on the phone yesterday. National Assembly Minority leader and ODM chairman John Mbadi followed suit and wrote to Sialiai directing the Clerk to channel lawmakers’ contributions to their parties. The Nasa secretariat is run by funds deducted from the lawmakers. Nasa is made up of ODM, ANC, Wiper and Ford Kenya. Nasa has moved to the Political Parties Tribunal, demanding that it continue to receive MPs’ monthly deductions. ODM has the largest number in both Houses of Parliament—76 MPs and 20 senators. Wiper has 23 MPs and three senators. ANC has 14 MPs and three senators. Ford Kenya has 12 members in the National Assembly and one senator. In total, the umbrella opposition has 152 members in both Houses of Parliament. More: Nasa infighting moves to parties tribunal over MPs contributions Click here for the latest political news
