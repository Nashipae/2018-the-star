Read: 15 dead, 60 injured in Gikomba market fire Past Gikomba fires have been met with promises to improve safety at the open-air market. They are not implemented. In June, 15 people died and 60 others sustained injuries after a huge blaze burnt stalls at the Kwa Mbao unit. Governor Mike Sonko promised that a multi-agency team would investigate the cause of the fire. He said the county government would work closely with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to unearth the cause of the fires. No information or solutions have been forthcoming. On September 10 last year, there was another blaze. Traders suspected it started from one of the stores before spreading to others. Barely a month later on October 6, a morning inferno destroyed property and displaced many traders. On June 23, 2015, a fire started at around 1am. Police said preliminary investigations showed arsonists caused the fire. Earlier in May, the market was razed. In 2014, there were two fires that left the market in ruins.
