Kenyatta National Hospital has been ordered to immediately admit murder suspect Joseph Irungu aka Jowie. The facility had declined because of a Sh31 million debt owed by the prisons. A medical report shows Irungu might suffer lung collapse and pneumonia if not attended to in good time. Irungu and TV journalist Jacque Maribe were charged with killing Monica Kimani on September 19. They pleaded not guilty. Yesterday, High Court judge James Wakiaga directed that Irungu undergo surgery to remove a bullet from his shoulder or he will review his October 30 decision that denied him bail, to enable him to seek medical attention at another facility. Irungu withdrew an application he filed to have Wakiaga disqualify himself over alleged bias. Maribe has been allowed access to her house, but her mobile phone wil be used as evidence. Probe into her car, allegedly used during the murder, is underway. Click here for the latest political news
