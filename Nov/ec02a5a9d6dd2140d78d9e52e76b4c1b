President Uhuru Kenyatta has put fishermen and fishmongers at the top of his agenda in his expected December 5 visit to Homa Bay. The President will inspect a modern fish market and a preservation plant at the Homa Bay main pier. The pier has been constructed at a cost of Sh8 million by woman representative Gladys Wanga through the National Government Affirmative Action Fund. Uhuru will also meet the Beach Management Unit officials, and present the fishermen with life jackets. On November 9, Public Service CAS Rachel Shebesh toured the regions ahead of the President’s visit. A water hyacinth harvester and a patrol boat are expected to land in Lake Victoria to boost the removal of the weed and improve patrols. Shebesh met county commissioner Macharia Irungu and Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata to brief them about the expected tour. Uhuru will also inspect the progress of the Huduma Mashiani project, meet the youth and present Sh10 million to Homa Bay Women’s Sacco. Fishermen have been facing several problems, including harassment by Ugandan Authorities, who sometimes force them to eat raw fish and the water hyacinth. Fishmongers have not also been spared. Their businesses have suffered following the drop in fish supply and increase in prices. This has forced them to engage in prostitution and sex-for-fish trade to sustain their families, especially widows and single mothers.
