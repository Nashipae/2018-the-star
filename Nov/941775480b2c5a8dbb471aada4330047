Lang’ata MP Nixon Korir has accused the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company and the county government of colluding to cut supply to his constituency. Korir told the Star yesterday his Lang’ata constituents are suffering in the hands of cartels supported by the Nawasco managing director Nahashon Muguna. “Nairobi Water officials are colluding with the cartels by delaying the water or totally blocking supply to the residents of Lang’ata in order for them to make a killing by selling water via bowsers,” Korir said. Nawasco boss Muguna however said Lang’ata is not getting enough because their pipeline passes through Kibera where cartels divert water to sell. He said that on November 26, 2018, they started construction where they shall connect all the pipes leading to Kibera and disconnect them from the main pipeline. “This will allow us to control water between Kibera and Lang’ata areas without any violence. The work is expected to take 10- 15 days,” Muguna said. Lang’ata gets its water through the Sasumua-Kabete water pipeline from Aberdare Forest. Other areas served by the pipeline are Waiyaki Way, Naivasha Road, Kangemi, Lavington, Westlands, Parklands, MP Shah and Aga Khan hospitals, Upper Hill and Kilimani. All these areas have not reported any water problems as Lang’ata suffers shortages. Langata leaders have had several meetings with Nawasco officials but say they only get endless promises.
