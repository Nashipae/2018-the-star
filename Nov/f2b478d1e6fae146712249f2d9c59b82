Members of the National Assembly yesterday voted to amend a House report to have the EACC and DCI investigate only 10 MPs over sugar bribery claims. The Powers and Privileges committee report tabled last week had recommended the two authorities investigate MPs. The legislators are alleged to have received bribes in August to reject the report on the importation of illegal and contaminated sugar. Majority leader Aden Duale supported the changes to the report, saying it was not right to indict all the 349 legislators yet some MPs who made the allegations failed to table evidence to the committee chaired by Speaker Justin Muturi. “Let those who made the allegations go to the EACC and DCI where they can give their evidence as ordinary members,” he said. “Some members think that they can only become popular by talking ill against their colleagues. I want to remind them that they are here to legislate and not to take bribes.” Minority leader John Mbadi said the House should reprimand colleagues who made the allegations and they should face the consequences for ruining the names of other MPs. The Powers and Privileges committee established that money could have exchanged hands the day before the report on contraband sugar was tabled to influence its outcome. The committee questioned 15 MPs as witnesses after some made bribery claims while others were adversely mentioned in the report. Those who appeared before the committee included Geoffrey Odanga (Matayos), Samuel Atandi (Alego Usonga), Gathoni Wamuchomba (Kiambu) Ayub Savula (Lugari) and Makokha Murunga (Matungu). Others were Didmas Barasa (Kimilili), Simba Arati (Dagoretti North), James K’Oyoo (Muhoroni), Jane Kihara (Naivasha) and Geoffrey Osotsi (nominated). Click here for the latest political news
