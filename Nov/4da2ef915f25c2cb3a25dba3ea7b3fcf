Businesses were disrupted yesterday in the North Rift region during a crackdown on matatu operators who have not complied with traffic rules. Hundreds of people who had planned to travel were stranded at the main stage in Eldoret town as owners of buses and matatus withdrew their vehicles from the road to avoid arrest. Uasin Gishu police commander Augustine Nthumbi warned matatu operators of strict unishment if they carry passengers without complying with the ‘Michuki rules’. The Centre e for Human Rights and Mediation, Eldoret chapter, has urged police not to turn the crackdown into an extortion business against matatu operators.
