The approach taken by Trade CS Peter Munya to revive coffee farming will not help much, Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua has said. He criticised Munya for meeting people who oppress farmers. The CS visited the area in September and met with sector players. Gachagua said solutions to problems facing farmers can only be found by meeting the growers, ­not those who do not understand the sector. He spoke at Ngurumo Primary School in the constituency. The lawmaker said even the taskforce formed by President Uhuru Kenyatta did not do its work thoroughly. Residents were discontented with its findings, he said. “All those given the responsibilities of reviving the sector by the President should come to the grassroots and listen to farmers,” he said. Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri, who was present at the function, defended the taskforce, saying what remains is implementation of its recommendations. He said the government was keen to improve coffee production. The two ministries will ensure farmers fetch better prices, he said. Of 32,000 bags of subsidised fertiliser needed in Nyeri county, the government has delivered 20,000. A bag goes for Sh1,500. "The rest will be delivered 'soon'," Kiunjuri said. He warned residents against engaging in corruption as the input is distributed. “I’ll visit all coffee factories and have a sitting with their committees and farmers so I hear their grievances,” he said. "After one year, we’ll come to audit whether the fertiliser achieved its objective." Click here for the latest political news
