Kenya Airways has confirmed a daily direct flight from Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Somalia capital Mogadishu and one return flight starting Thursday. The carrier said the move followed increased demand on the route as it stretched its wings in a move expected to boost trade with the Horn of Africa nation. “The addition of this route to our network demonstrates our commitment to improving connectivity on the African continent, while creating new opportunities for corporates, investors, traders and tourists”, said Kenya Airways CEO Sebastian Mikosz in a statement. The flight operated by Jambojet on the Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, will depart Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), Nairobi at 0740 hours and depart Aden Adde International Airport, Mogadishu at 1045 hours to arrive back in Nairobi at 1300 hours. The launch of Mogadishu flights by Kenya Airways is coming just days after Ethiopian Airline resumed the route on November 2. Ethiopian Airlines suspended its operations in Somalia following the outbreak of hostilities between the two countries in the late 1970s.
