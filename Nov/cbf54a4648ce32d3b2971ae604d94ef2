Eight Ambira Boys High School students caught on video last week hurling insults at CSs Amina Mohamed and Fred Matiang’i have been detained for seven more days. In the clip widely shared on social media, the students claimed to have cheated in the KCSE exam as they burnt their books. The eight appeared yesterday before Ukwala resident magistrate Gladys Adhiambo but did not take a plea after the prosecution requested for seven days for investigations. The boys will remain in custody at Ugunja police station until December 3, when the case will be mentioned in the same court. Reacting to the incident, Knec chairman George Magoha said the moral decay in some of the students is regrettable. Addressing journalists at Rangala Girls yesterday as he monitored the KCSE exams, Magoha said if it is discovered that the Ambira students cheated as they claimed in the video, then action will be taken. “We have already prescribed what we do to people who cheat and that is what we are going to do,” Magoha said. He said they will not profile any school but if they confirm an institution cheated, then the law will take its course without discrimination. Magoha said in such cases, they will only deal with individuals especially those involved in the malpractice. He condemned parents for failing to raise their children with good morals under the guise of being busy. “If you see students insulting leaders then that reflects badly on parents,” Magoha said. The Knec chairman also banned what four form leavers call “academic fire” after completing their studies. “There is nothing like academic fire where you burn books before you even know that you have passed. A number of those books belong to the government,” Magoha said. He said that lack of good parenting had contributed to the high number of pregnancies in schools.
