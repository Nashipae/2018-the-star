The number of people in prisons awaiting trial has reduced by 30 per cent since a bail and bond team was formed. Bail and Bond Implementation Committee chairperson Justice Jessie Lesiit yesterday said the task force formed in 2015 has made numerous strides in decongesting prisons. She said magistrates have been educated on the need to grant bail and bond, especially if there are no compelling reasons not to. “It is a success story that can be attributed directly to the committee and the fact that more magistrates are sensitised to apply policy guidelines,” Justice Lesiit said. She said before the committee was formed, the population in remand was very high. The committee operates under the National Council on the Administration of Justice (NCAJ), whose chairperson is the Chief Justice. Lesiit spoke at Murang’a police station. She said the committee has five teams that are visiting courts, prisons and police stations to establish the level of compliance with bail and bond guidelines. They direct the police and courts on how to assess whether to grant bail or bond and how to arrive at the terms. Lesiit said various regions have their unique challenges that determine how much bail and bond to grant. She said in Mwea, Kirinyaga county, people are able to meet high bond terms of up to Sh100,000 due to the farming in the area. In Murang’a, she said, the highest bail issued at the police station is Sh20,000, with most cases being Sh10,000. Justice Lesiit said they are also educating courts on the need to verify authenticity of security documents issued by suspects, such as logbooks and titles deeds. “Someone has to be sent to the land to verify the originality of the document in case of a title deed,” she said.
