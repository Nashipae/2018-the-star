Lawmakers will catch up with you,” Mucheru said. Mucheru said M-Pesa began without a policy and MPs were forced to make laws to guide its use along the way. “It is one of those inventions that have turned out to be a big success,” he said. Flying drones is regulated by the government. Mucheru said licensing film makers to use the drones will encourage investment in the creative industry and create jobs. He said China has opened its film market to Kenya and is willing to work with local film makers to produce creative works that would be screened in China. The CS said the government will streamline the industry and ensure expeditious processing and issuance of licences.
