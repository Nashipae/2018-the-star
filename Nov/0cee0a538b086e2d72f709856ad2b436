The death toll from the Ugandan cruise boat accident has risen to 29 after rescuers pulled more bodies from the water. The lot died when a cruise boat capsized in poor weather in Lake Victoria off Uganda's Mukono district, close to the capital Kampala. Police said on Saturday at least 10 people had died in the accident. There are also reports some rescuers died. "The boat was overloaded and secondly there was bad weather," Patrick Onyango told Reuters, adding the boat was carrying 84 people, most of them revellers. "Our rescue team is still on the ground trying to rescue whoever we can find." Widely circulated videos show that the occupants were drinking, dancing and listening to music before the boat sank a short distance from the shore.
