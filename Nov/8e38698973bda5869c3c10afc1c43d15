Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru says she has withdrawn her defamation case against former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. She said this in a tweet after meeting with the AU High Representative for Infrastructure at the latter's Capitol Hill office on Wednesday. The row between Raila and Waiguru arose in 2015 after the ODM leader demanded the governor's prosecution for graft at NYS. The issue culminated into the county boss suing Raila for linking her to the loss of Sh791 million at the youth agency. Waiguru, then Devolution CS, sued Raila on September 29, 2015, accusing him of recklessly tarnishing her name. The ODM leader, on the other hand, sought the court's say on his call for Waiguru to be subjected to a lifestyle audit. But after their meeting, the Kirinyaga county boss said the matter stands settled 'in the spirit of cohesion'. "Just had a meeting with Raila on the outstanding matter in court. In the spirit of cohesion and reconciliation in the country, the matter stands settled," she said. Early in the year, Waiguru had equested the High Court to allow the case against Raila to proceed. Raila had requested that the hearing be stopped until he files an appeal challenging a ruling issued last November. The ruling allowed the governor to conceal certain information regarding her lifestyle.
