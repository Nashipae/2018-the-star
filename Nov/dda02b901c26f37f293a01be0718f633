Experienced national team player Brackcidise Agala and Kwanthanze Secondary School coach Justine Kigwari will coach the national Under-17 girls team as they start residential training at Moi Stadium indoor arena, Kasarani next week. The December holiday camp organized by Kenya Academy of Sports in conjunction with Kenya Volleyball Federation is expected to feature 25 players from various secondary schools across the nation. This will be Agala’s first assignment as a coach having undergone Federation of International Volleyball (FIVB) Level Two coaching course in Nairobi last year. While Kigwari’s expertise will come in handy, having guided his school to both the national and East Africa Secondary School championship titles this year. KVF second vice chairman, David Kilundo, said the initiative wouldn’t have come at a right time as they seek to prepare teams ahead of forthcoming age group events. “It’s a welcome move and a perfect position to start from. We decided to pick on the U-17 because that age is crucial if we are to field a team at the U20 or U23 championships or better still, the U-18 event,” said Kilundo. “We have also engaged Kenya Academy of Sports to help us have the same arrangement with the boys in the near future. We hope to have a smooth transition of players from age group categories to the national teams. We hope to have a similar camp for both boys and girls during the 2019 April holidays.” KVF technical director David Lung’aho said the process of selection is ongoing and the team should start training next week if all goes well. “We are targeting at least 25 players at the end of the selection process. We are aware that many schools have closed and it may be difficult to get all the players we want but adjust with the number we will get,” said Lung’aho.
