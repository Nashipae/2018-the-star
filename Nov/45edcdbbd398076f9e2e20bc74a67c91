Traders in Liwatoni, Mombasa, are counting losses following demolitions executed by the county government on Wednesday night. The lot said they were not given notice of the demolitions said to be for clearing the area ahead of President Uhuru Kenyatta's visit. Uhuru is expected in Liwatoni on Monday to launch the Kenya Coast Guard Service. County communication director Richard Chacha denied claims the demolition was because of Uhuru's visit. He said the structures were removed as part of 'restoration efforts' in the county. "The county is undergoing a transformation under the Mombasa regeneration project," Chacha said. Scrap metal trader Paul Mwaniki said he could not salvage any of his property by the time he was informed of the demolition. "The few items that could have been salvaged had been stolen," he said. Mwaniki said he has suffered a Sh400,000 loss after taking a loan to run the business. "I had already paid the county government for my licence for 2018," Mwaniki said. Margaret Otieno said her 11-month-old baby was almost injured as bulldozers brought down her structure. "I was in the process of removing my belongings when a bulldozer almost crashed my kid. Is that right, really?" she said. Click here for the latest political news
