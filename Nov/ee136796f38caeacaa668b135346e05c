The Garissa government yesterday issued a one-month notice to traders who have built structures on road reserves to demolish them. Some 180 traders were issued with the notice. “It has come to our attention that your extension/enclosure/parking of buses/lorries is causing obstruction to other road users, you are forthwith required to remove the obstruction within 30 days, otherwise, it will be removed without any further reference to [you] and at your cost,” reads the letter. It was signed by Roads and Transport chief officer Abdi Dekow, who urged them to comply with the order. The notice is likely to raise political temperatures. Similar warnings have in the past led to a huge furore from politicians opposed to the eviction of traders.
