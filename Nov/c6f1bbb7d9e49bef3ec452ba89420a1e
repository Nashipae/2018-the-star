Kenya Defence Forces boxers emerged second behind hosts Algeria as curtains came down on the 5th African Military Boxing Championships in Algiers, Algeria. Silver medallists were Isaac Mejar, Fredrick Onyango, Simon Mulinge, Nick Okoth and Blackmoses Mathenge while Abednego Kyalo, Edwin Okongo, Victor Odhiambo and Nick Abaka grabbed bronze medals. Algeria won all the 10 gold medals at stake with Tunisia settling for third with two silvers and four bronze medals. Flyweight Simon Mulinge was the first Kenyan to the ring against Morodjane Oussama of Algeria. Controlling the tempo from the onset, Mulinge appeared to have done enough to warrant a win. Bantamweight, LCpl Isaack Mejar gave his opponent Litim Khalil of Algeria a scare, though fighting cautiously with a cut that he had sustained in the semis, he gave as much as he took. A public warning in the second round by Cameroonian Referee did not dampen his courage, rather it brought out the warrior spirit in him. The decision went to the Algerian. Welterweight and team captain Sgt Mathenge went toe-to-toe against Belhout Houcine of Algeria, trading punches to the joy of the cheering fans, before the judges decision went to his opponent. Heavyweight LCpl Fredrick Onyango up against a taller opponent, Hamani Mo Said of Algeria connected some good shots as he mostly worked to the body. His opponent was not at peace as he struggled to keep Onyango at bay with long range jabs. The decision went to Algerian. African champion, Nick Okoth went pound for pound with Benlaribi Abdenacer, unleashing a flurry of punches forcing his opponent to backpedal.
