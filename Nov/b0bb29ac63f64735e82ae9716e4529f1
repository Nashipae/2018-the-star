ODM leader Raila Odinga visited Kiambu Jubilee spokesman Nginyo Kariuki on Thursday at his Red Hill home to wish him a quick recovery after he fell ill. Raila also delivered best wishes from President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Opposition chief lauded Kariuki for his immense contribution in protecting the environment. "Tunamshukuru sana kwa kutukaribisha hapa na kwa kulinda mazingira yetu. Tukiharibu mazingira yetu hakuna uhai kwa nchi," he said. (We thank him for hosting us and for protecting our environment. If we destroy our environment there is no life). "Climate change is real and it is affecting the whole world," Raila said. Raila said the Building Bridges task force formed after the March 9 handshake between him and President Uhuru seeks to uniteÂ Kenyans. "Tunataka kuona kama wakenya wanaungana pamoja hio ndio maana ya BBI, kuunganisha makabila yote ya Kenya," he said. (We want to see all Kenyans live in peace and that is the sole purpose of the task force. To bring together all tribes of Kenya).
