Kiptoo was arrested October 27 in Umoja Estate in Nakuru but Eldoret Chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa gave police 14 days to complete investigations into the murder of Loise. Loise was an employee of the Teachers Service Commission in Uasin Gishu. Her decomposing body was found in her house in Kiplombe area within Eldoret three weeks ago. She had deep cuts all over her body and police suspect she was raped before being killed. Two other suspects, Laban Cheruiyot and Simon Lumile, were released last week following directives from the DPP's office that they will be witnesses against Kiptoo.
