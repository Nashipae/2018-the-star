Fourteen-year-old Ashley Mwende, who lost a kidney and had her right hand fractured in a road accident in August, scored 423 marks. The accident killed 10 of her colleagues. The Mwingi St Gabriel Boarding Primary School candidate wrote her exam  smarting from a missing kidney that was removed following the accident. Ashley was among pupils who survived a road crash on August 4, when their bus was involved in a head on collision and plunged into Kanginga bridge. Nine of the pupils who died in the crash were among the 41 who had registered as candidates. Ashley was ranked second after Eric Ngombo, who scored 425.  Five other students scored over 400 marks. Ashley attributed her good performance to Gods’ grace, prayer and hard work. She said was happy to have excelled considering she had not fully healed by exam time. Head teacher  Viginiah Kiilu said  the  “impressive performance”  by Ashely  was unexpected  due to her injuries. “Soon after the accident, Ashley had to learn to use her left hand. Miraculously, by the time the exam started, she had learned to use the right hand again,” Kiilu said. She said overall, the performance of the 2018 candidates had improved from 357 last year to 373.3. See also: Thika boy outlives preterm birth to shine in KCPE with 445 marks Click here for
