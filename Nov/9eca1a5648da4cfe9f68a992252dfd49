Mean Machine skipper Shadon Munoko has been called up to the Kenya Sevens squad training. Munoko has impressed for the varsity side in the Impala Floodlit tournament as well as performed well at the national Sevens circuit. He is expected to add competition to the squad that has been training for the past two weeks. Munoko, who plays at number eight, will be hoping to bring his form to the training in a bid to benefit from the 2018-2019 season copntracts, which will be awarded to 18 players mid next month. Murunga is expected to name his two squads for the Safari Sevens early next week and the new faces are hoping to catch the eye of the technical bench. "You will see two competitive teams playing at the Safari Sevens and we want to win it to give ourselves a good chance of performing well at the World Sevens Series opener in Dubai and Cape Town next month," he said. He said the Safari Sevens will be used to gauge the players before signing contracts for the upcoming season. "The tournament will give the players an opportunity to prove their worth and be part of the team that goes to the World Series." Murunga expects a stern test in Dubai, where Shujaa meet Fiji, France and Scotland in Pool B. “It’s a competitive pool and we still have three weeks of training to get our systems and structures right. However, it’s something the boys are looking forward to,” added Murunga. Elsewhere, Homeboyz have signed centre Mark Ongayo from Nondies ahead of the Kenya Cup season. Ongayo played for Nondies for one season and his play caught the attention of the deejays who snapped his services. Ongayo is set to make his debut against his former employees on November 17. Homeboyz have for the last two seasons lost to Kabras in the Kenya Cup semis and have set their sights on winning the league this season. Click here for the latest political news
