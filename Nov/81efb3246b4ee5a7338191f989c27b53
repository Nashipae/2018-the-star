Chief officers in Machakos have reported to work amid objection from MCAs. This is after Governor Alfred Mutua welcomed them to their new stations on Monday. In a statement, Mutua told of the officers to embrace the Maendeleo Chap Chap philosophy where speed is of the essence without compromising on quality. "We are working towards pulling Machakos from the Third World into the First World. I'm am confident that this new crop of young, fresh officers will serve our people with Integrity and purpose," Mutua said. MCAs have been up in arms over the Governor's appointments, terming them unconstitutional. They criticised Mutua for appointing the County Secretary and 25 chief officers without the assembly's approval.

"It is worrying that the Governor has continued to make ill-advised and illegal appointments in the county Public Service," Mwangangi said. She addressed the press at the assembly's premises. Mwangangi said this happened a fortnight after the High Court in Machakos declared that some CECs are serving illegally without the assembly's approval. She said another case is pending in court challenging the appointment of CECs. Mwangangi said the assembly received a list of 25 nominees for the positions of County Secretary and chief officers on August 1, from the Governor. She said on August 7, communication on the names was received by the assembly and the list sent to the relevant committees for vetting. Mwangangi said the committees were mandated to table their reports within 21 sitting days. But some MCAs who support Mutua's administration trashed the Speaker's claims. They accused Mwangangi of leading the opposition MCAs in holding Mutua's administration hostage. Click here for the latest political news
