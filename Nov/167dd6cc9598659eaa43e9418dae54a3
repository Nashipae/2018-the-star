The High Court in Eldoret has ordered Uasin Gishu county government to pay a contractor Sh30 million owed to his company for construction of a hospital. The money is 30 per cent of the cost of construction of Moiben subcounty hospital. Governor Jackson Mandagoâ€™s administration was found to have breached an agreement signed with Zedka Technical Ltd Company which was legally awarded a tender to construct the hospital. The county failed to reply to a suit filed by the construction firm through its director Martin Chemonges to order the county pay the money for the tender number UGC/47/2014-2015.
