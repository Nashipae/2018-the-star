Kenya National Union of Teachers wants the long end of year school holidays scrapped to curb teenage pregnancies. Secretary General Wilson Sossion made the remarks on Sunday in Kajiado during the celebration of ACK’s Silver Jubilee in the region. He said the number of girls falling pregnant is between 13,000 and 15,000 nationwide. Sossion said this is alarming and calls for divine intervention by churches. “I'm appealing to the Kenya National Examination Council to consider providing supplementary tests to pregnant students three to four months after delivery,” Sossion said. He said a lot of free time in teenagers' hands "creates a devilish mind". Sossion said many of them are tempted to indulge in ungodly activities. “Without the Church, we cannot raise upright children. Let us embrace the good work Churches are doing to inculcate Christian values to our children,” the nominated MP said. “We are living in a society where values and systems are breaking down. Our children require a befitting environment in the Church to enable them to grow into God-fearing individuals," he said. Sossion said as a result of early pregnancies, young girls slide into hopelessness. His remarks were supported by ACK Archbishop Right Reverend Jackson ole Sapit, Kajiado Central MP Memusi Kanchory, Governor Joseph Lenku and host Bishop Gadiel Lenini. Kanchory said the Church has a huge responsibility in moulding a society. “Our daughters getting pregnant in their teenage years will not take Kenya anywhere,” Kanchory said. At the same time, he appealed to the Church not to accept blood/dirty money from politicians in the name of building the House of God. Click here for the latest political news
