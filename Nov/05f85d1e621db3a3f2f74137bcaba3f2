Garissa women aspirants and leaders yesterday vowed to support fellow women in the 2022 election. Speaking during the closure of a mentorship forum for women aspirants organised by the parliamentary women association Kewopa, they unanimously vowed to support each other to secure more elective posts. Nominated senator Falhada Iman said the biggest threat to women leadership is women themselves. “As women, we need to first recognise our power and fully maximise it. Undermining and fighting each other only works to the advantage of men,” she said. Many communities in Northeastern hold conservative views on women’s leadership based on their religion and culture. During last year’s General Election, only former Wajir women representative Fatuma Ibrahim and Sophia Abdi Noor vied in Tarbaj and Ijara constituencies. Iman said the fact that Noor became the first woman to be elected in the region gives hope to women aspirants. “When we look at Sophia, a role model to hundreds of young aspiring leaders and look at what she has been able to achieve over time, then we have every reason to believe that the future looks bright.” Wajir nominated senator Farhiya Haji asked women leaders to prioritise women’s needs, saying economic disparity has contributed to lack of independence in decision making. Kewopa is a cross party caucus for women parliamentarians that advocates for women’s rights. It currently has 97 members from the National Assembly and Senate.
