ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi has urged MPs to tighten their oversight role to strengthen the fight against corruption. Mudavadi on Saturday said poor oversight had created loopholes being exploited by the corrupt. Citing the controversial sugar report, the former Sabatia MP said lawmakers rejected the report yet it sought to address many concerns of cane farmers. He said MPs should question why maize farmers have not been paid. “When a maize farmer has not been paid yet Parliament has allocated the resource to pay them, are we wrong to say legislators have failed on their oversight mandate?” Mudavadi said. “We want to see our MPs improving their oversight role to enable the country win the war on graft.” Mudavadi spoke in Kasipul constituency in Homa Bay during a fundraiser at Nyabondo-Kachieng SDA. Present were Chief JusticeJ David Maraga, MPs Ong’ondo Were (Kasipul), Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay), Alfred Agoi (Sabatia), Adipo Okuome (Karachuonyo) and Eve Obara (Kabondo Kasipul). Mudavadi said MPs did not allocate sufficient funds for the Judiciary during budget formulation. He said inadequate resources have made it difficult for the Judiciary to implement projects in time. Mudavadi said he was working closely with ODM leader Raila Odinga, despite the latter's new job as AU’s High Representative for Infrastructure Development. He said the country cannot run without an Opposition to check government excesses, including graft. “Raila and I are one. What I stand for is what Raila supports. Our hope is to make Kenya a better country for future generations,” he said. Maraga said they have drawn a master plan to be taken to Parliament for approval to enable the Judiciary to identify where new courts will be built. Click here for the latest political news
